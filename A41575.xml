         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>
               </hi> Am in a ſtrait in this mine attempt, in daring to dedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate this ſmall piece unto your Highneſs, the ſpirit of man ſtanding alwayes in ſuch readi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs (naturally) as a croking frog, in thoſe Magicians of Egypt, to procure
<pb facs="tcp:40942:3"/>
the favour of, and gain intereſt in, the moſt publick and eminent men, only for private ends and ſelf-reſpects.</p>
            <p>But the ſimplicity and ſingleneſs of my proper intent is ſuch in this deſigne, together with the freedome of my ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit to proſtrate my humble diſires, (in publick view) after the proſperity of your Highneſs in eternal things, that I am born up, and incouraged here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto.</p>
            <p>For God hath ſhewed me what all terrene and temporary affairs amount unto; yea, even of the greateſt men, not being uſed to promote the honour of that one only, and eternally anointed.</p>
            <p>For though a man may be but of a low ſtature, even as a ſhrub in his age, in the view and account of men, yet if he run well with Zacheus, and be take
<pb facs="tcp:40942:3"/>
himſelf to the top of the Sycomore tree, he may come to take a juſt and joyful view, of him who is Lord over all; though otherwiſe the preſs of ſuch as are taller then he, may ſeem to hinder him from coming nearer; but if he know the way wherein the Lord paſſeth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long, he may take a direct and fruitful view of him, notwithſtanding the crowd.</p>
            <p>I know not but that God hath made your Highneſs the mirrour of this age, as a ſo exemplary for that to come, wherein the greateſt glories of this world in the men thereof, may take a true view of their deformed faces, and that in the ſeveral feitures and figures thereof.</p>
            <p>For I could never learn that you have purſued the honour thereof, but
<pb facs="tcp:40942:4"/>
only have been conſtrained through the urgency of a mighty hand of God pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuing your ſelf, to yield your ſelf over thereunto, when neceſsitie hath clothed you upon, and adorned you therewith.</p>
            <p>Which is a thing rare to be found in this generation, or in any age, and therefore a myrrour, to be looked into, and admired with reſpect unto the beſt of men alſo.</p>
            <p>No man can deny, but that God hath made you an inſtrument whereby to work wonderful changes, and that in high, though tranſitory affairs, making you a terrour to your enemies, and in a covert from the ſtorm, un o ſuch as pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs friendſhip unto the cauſe of Chriſt.</p>
            <p>I muſt confeſs, that the reports which I have heard, the things which I have ſeen, that have proceeded from
<pb facs="tcp:40942:4"/>
your own lips, as alſo what I have ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly felt, and taſted of (though in a remote corner of the earth) have ſo diſſolved my heart to take the impreſsi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons thereof, that I cannot but perſwade my ſelf that your ſpirit profoundly looks into, and is in honourable and skilful motion, activity, and atchieve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, in, and about that only weighty and great change, which concerns the life and death, humiliation, and raign of the Son of God; a change of ſtate, carrying in it kingdom, power, and glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, infinitely tranſcending the rule and protection of <hi>England, Scotland,</hi> and <hi>Ireland,</hi> with the dominions thereto belonging.</p>
            <p>For this hath in it reallity, of all kingdones, in their ſeverall and vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

<pb facs="tcp:40942:5"/>
exempting one of all them which the common adverſary the devil propoſed unto Chriſt, but the wiſdome whereby he preſents them, would have falſified them unto Chriſt, in point of that whe e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the reallity of power and glory is properly terminated, and for ever ſtands, which being truly erected and rightly ordered, never departs from you; no more then the glory of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt and victory, together with his ſtrength, wiſdome, and skill to raigne, departs from the ſon of God, but abide upon him for ever.</p>
            <p>I durſt not preſume this ſmall piece to your Highneſs, which was bu briefly uttered according to our poore accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtomed indeavours in our dayly exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe, without either Library, or time to make uſe of any ſuch things, in this
<pb facs="tcp:40942:5"/>
rude, incumbring, and way-leſs wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſs.</p>
            <p>But that I think it hath in it thoſe two mites, which that poor widow caſt into the treaſury, which proved of more worth in Chriſts acceptation, then the offerings of Scribes, Phariſes, and El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, and all the wealthy of the world; for ſhe gave out all her living, which conſiſted in two mites: the word mite is ſuch a diminative, as that it pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cures, and gains, all increaſe; for ſhe gives away the wealth and glory of her husband unto diminution, which is the riches and glory of the creature, in which tender, gift, or diminution, doth conſiſt the Croſs of Chriſt, in his death to all carnal and tranſient things, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per to the life and law of the fleſh.</p>
            <p>And ſhe throws in all the miſeries
<pb facs="tcp:40942:6"/>
of mankind, which might ariſe, and grow, out of her widow-hood, and loſs of all her former ſuppl es and excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lencies, in the loſs and diminution whereof, the Son of God makes mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt his own riches and power; and theſe are mites, or diminutives, yea, they are individuals, we cannot give part of either of them into the treaſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, according to the nature of an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable offering, but we muſt give them all; for he hath all our glory humane, ſo, as to conſume and diminiſh it upon the altar, and he hath all the miſeries of man (thus offered) to diminiſh it alſo, in the bearing of it away, as up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the head of that ſcape-goat into the wilderneſs, or land of <hi>Shiner,</hi> to ſet it there upon its proper baſe.</p>
            <p>Which twain, namely, temporary
<pb facs="tcp:40942:6"/>
ranſient glory, and miſery, are all that man lives upon, <hi>viz.</hi> upon his own bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily or humane exerciſe, and doings, thinking thereby to obtain the favour of God; or elſe upon his own tranſient and humane ſufferings, whereby he hopes to eſcape the diſpleaſure of God: which twain make but one farthing, or quadril, that is, one ſtate or condition of man, conſidered naturally and ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginally, as ſpringing from the earth, or that firſt Adam conſiſting thereof.</p>
            <p>But being thus caſt into the treaſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, or ſtorehouſe of the Son of God, it is that one ſtate and condition of Jeſus Chriſt, in whoſe approbation we are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived (as that widow of threeſcore yeares of age or above) into that houſe and temple of God, out of which trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry we find ſufficiency and plenty to live
<pb facs="tcp:40942:7"/>
upon forever; whereas the rich give only out of their ſuperfluity, for it is ever ſuperfluous to add or lay out any of the glory &amp; wealth of the creature, unto the riches and glory of the Son of God, which is the proper way of living to the men of the world, either to add ſomething to the crown or croſs of Chriſt, that is humaue and temporary, and whatſoever they give out in that manner, they ſtill keep in the main ſtock of their own livelyhood in themſelves, which living after the ſleſh is death, &amp; ſuch riches are a meer deprivation of all the holy things of God.</p>
            <p>But a true widow neither owns the worlds miſeries, nor yet its mercies, for ſhe knows both the one &amp; the other are cruelty, but only lives upon that ſtock in the treaſury in the diminiſhing &amp; demoliſhing of them both.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:40942:7"/>
If theſe two mites were not here ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred, in the true manner of the offering of them, as alſo the nature of the ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluous offerings of the rich (and that in ſuch ſort) as they are not found in the common records, pulpit, ſchools, elder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhips, and great ſtudents of this age, I would hide my ſelf in ſome corner of the temple, rather then make tender of them to publick view, much leſs to one of your atchievments, &amp; give me leave humbly to profeſs, that I know the principles upon w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> the common prieſthood of this age ſtands, to be inconſiſtant to the true intent &amp; ſcope of theſe following lines; &amp; in point of a matter of no leſs weight then of life &amp; death eternal, &amp; if any man, receiving his miniſtry from the degrees in ſchools, laying on of hands by the presbitery or elderſhip, as commonly
<pb facs="tcp:40942:8"/>
and practiſed in theſe dayes, or ſuch as are appointed to examine, correct, and reform, inſufficient miniſtries; if any ſuch will undertake to anſwer for themſelves, by giving a punctual and plain account of their doctrine, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the true intent and ſcope of this ſmall Epiſtle, in any, or in all the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars contained therein, not ſtriving about words, but look to the truth of the matter; they ſhall (if God ſpare life) be as faithfully anſwered, with profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion made, what is thought of their ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments, and upon what grounds, as this is faithfully, and loyally, out of an affectionated heart preſented to your Highneſs.</p>
            <p>And that to the intent that in caſe a carnal Counſel, Synod, or Elderſhip, ſhould paſs ſome unjuſt cenſure upon it,
<pb facs="tcp:40942:8"/>
branding it with errour, when men now awake, may be fallen aſleep, there might be a remonſtrance found to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare the nature of their act; for it is an eaſie thing for ſuch to condemn, as errours, ſuch things as come not within the compaſs of carnal capacity, or elſe ſtands in there light to hinder their at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining to the glory of this world.</p>
            <p>And as for Logical argument, height of ſtyle, Elegant, and Rhetori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal expreſsions; as we have little of them, ſo we matter them not much, but only keep to that real truth and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, which will abide in us for ever; yet do we not deny unto any thing, its proper excellency<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> or eminency, in whatſoever it excelleth: Therefore we can freely give all relations a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt men, their proper terms and
<pb facs="tcp:40942:9"/>
titles, afford them their proper places and offices, if conducing unto, and tol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerable in humane ſocieties, as well as we can afford the Sun, Moon, and Stars in the firmament, their names, places, offices, or that conjugall tie be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt man and wife, for the propaga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of mankind on the earth.</p>
            <p>Elſe we ſhould go about to race out that, which the almighty hath ſtamped upon the creature, as a document, to fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure out, and point unto eternal things in Chriſt, and ſo lay mans ſpirit waſt of any capacity, to gather up the mind and intents of one another, whereby we ſhould become barbarous each to other, debarred and ſhut out, from the uſe of communion, in that way of rationalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, wherein properly man excels all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther creatures.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:40942:9"/>
For how ſhould we know, or to what ſhould we have recourſe, in the divers and variety of diſtinctions appertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the kingdome of God, to make them ſpeakable one to another, if not to the ſeveral diſtinctions which God hath ſet among the creatures, unto which he elegantly aludes in the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſsing and revealing of himſelf, as in way of family, by father and ſon, in way of order, by city and field; and in way of rule and authority, by Prince and people: if we ſhould not main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain ſuch names, terms, and titles, how ſhould the figure or letter of the word be preſerved in the world, which proves as true a ſnare, through the wiſdome of the ſerpent, to catch men in, unto de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction, as the temptations of Satan have an iſsue and way of eſcape given

            <p>The moſt profitable uſe that I know, of all things viſible to humane under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, is to take them all as proper

            <p>Thus much through infinite favour and grace God hath revealed unto us, that whereſoever that ſpirit reſides not, which firſt framed the mind of the Son of God, according to the eternal wiſdom, to judge of all things as God judgeth, the love of God was never ſhed abroad in that heart, for the ſpirit of faith works by love, and where the love of God is not, there is the love of this world, which is of that wicked ones; and the love of the world is enmity with God<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and the ſpirit of envy never makes good conſtruction of the expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions of him it doth repugn; therefore where the Spirit of
<pb facs="tcp:40942:12"/>
Chriſt reſides not, there can never be good conſtruction given of the words of Chriſt, for he hath a name given him that none can read but himſelf, and he is called the word of God, therefore all other readers are falſe interpreters, and that is the only in<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> let and progreſs of ſin and death in the world un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to this day.</p>
            <p>There be many who arogate a Call to interpret the word of God; Some holding themſelves ſet a part from the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon affairs of this life in ſuch ſort, as they are not to inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meddle with any temporary occaſions; but to have all things brought in unto them, that concerns this preſent life, by the labours of and means of others, who ſtand not in that relation, neither to God nor men, which themſelves do, being men whoſe Calling is ſpiritual, and therefore not to be imployed about any carnal things, aſſuming Scripture for that purpoſe; not only from the equity of that Law gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven concerning <hi>Levy,</hi> but alſo as the Stand in the room of Chriſt, who is of greater deſerts to be maintained then <hi>Levy</hi> was.</p>
            <p>There is one Scripture looks earneſtly upon me concerning this Point, which ſuch men make great uſe of to prove their Apoſtolical Authority to require Tythes, Stipends and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributions; together with the honour of the upermoſt Seats where they come, with reſpect unto the dignity of their Calling and Office, above others of the Saints of God, in which regard (ſay they) all others are become debtors unto them, to contribute both wealth and honour, for which they aledge (as one ſpecial ground for ſuch ſupply) as having di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Authority on their ſide, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> Cap. 9.</p>
            <p>Which form of words they deal with as they do with all other expreſſions in the word of God, uſing it to mans ends and intents, and not according to the mind and intent of the Son of God.</p>
            <p>For that which they go about to prove their Calling by to be ſpiritual and heavenly, is a direct Declaration, given out by the Spirit of God to prove their Miniſtry to be carnal and earthly; give me leave therefore as briefly as I can, to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare from that Scripture, what God ſeems <hi>(as by his eye)</hi> to direct and guide unto.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:40942:12"/>
Our Apoſtle in the former Chapter ſheweth the difference between Knowledge and Knowledge; the one in way of the fall of man from God; the other in the way of Reſurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and Aſcenſion to God; the one puffeth up, (as an em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pty blader filled only with wind) above others; the other is filled with love to edification, which ever proſtrates it ſelf to the party known, where or in whatſoever he appeareth; the one ſitting at meat, or communicating in the Idols Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple; the other refuſing to eat carnally ſo long as the world ſtands, rather then to offend the Brother-hood.</p>
            <p>And having concluded that an Idol, or an Idolathite (for there is a generation of them) is nothing in the world; and that there is but one God in truth and verity, though many do aſſume the names and titles of that one God; yet an Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lathite is nothing in the world, though they ſo aſſume, and arogate the tearms, becauſe the Son of God who is the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker of all things, never contributed any thing unto the form thereof, no more then it can be ſaid that the holy Son of God did ever give out any thing to the being of the unclean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of that unclean ſpirit, namely, the Devil, which an Idol is concluded to be by the Spirit of God; for whatſoever the Son of God gives being unto, is a work of Creation: but an Idol the Devils, is that <hi>Abaddon,</hi> and <hi>Apollion,</hi> that is, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction, which is nothing of the work of God in Heaven or in earth, and ſo is nothing in the world: Therefore but one God, or power of Creation of all things, for an Idol is the ruin and deſtruction of Gods proper creating vertue where it is erected, which erection of an Idol is to terminate the ſcope, true and proper intent, of any part of Gods word in any thing whatſoever beſides Jeſus Chriſt and him crucified, beſides which our Apoſtle acknowledgeth he deſires to know nothing.</p>
            <p>For all other knowledge beſides that, or without that is thus explained by our Apoſtle, <hi>viz. If any man,</hi> or any thing, <hi>ſee thee that haſt knowledge,</hi> or ſee thee knowledge, or thee that art knowledge; for ſuch as mans wiſdom or know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge is, ſuch is the man, for as it gives man his being, above all other creatures, ſo it gives diſtinctions of men among
<pb facs="tcp:40942:13"/>
themſelves: <hi>Sit at meat in the Idols Temple,</hi> that is, conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue and abide communicating in the word and worſhip of God, as terminating any part of, or thing in, the Temple, or Pallace, in any carnal and fading matter or thing. <hi>Shall not the conſcience,</hi> or ſhall not that knowing together in thee, for there is a unity in Idols worſhip as certainly as there is in the worſhip of the true God in ſpirit and truth. <hi>Of the weak,</hi> that is, of ſuch as are ſick, or dead, being without, and deſtitute of that healthful Spirit of grace and life in Chriſt. <hi>Be imboldned to eat things ſacrificed to Idols,</hi> that is, what ever is in thee, or belonging unto that aſſembly of evil doers, ſhall be encouraged to yeild up it ſelf to the Rule of ſuch knowledge, for all things in man are governed by wiſdom and a ſpirit of teaching; therefore all things concerning the ſons of men, make their addreſſes to the light ſet up in the mind of man, of what nature or mind ſoever it be, to take their form, receive commiſſion, as alſo inſtruction for their progreſs in execution; therefore thou Idolatrous knowledg ſet up in the Idols Temple, art become the Authour of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction, for there was never any deſtroyed ſince the world was, but by this thy knowledge, which puffs up with pride as an empty bladder, filled with nothing but with the wind of Satannical deluſion, where the ſubſtantiality of the Son of God never was, nor never will be.</p>
            <p>Therefore he ſaith, <hi>Through thy Knowledge,</hi> or through this knowledge, for the party and property to know are ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſeparated, for man is not man but by ability to know, and that with reſpect to a God to be communicated with and worſhipped. <hi>Shall thy weak brother periſh for whom Chriſt dyed?</hi> that is, thou art the proper deſtruction of mankind, and for to ſave mankind Chriſt dyed; ſo that all thy weak brethren, ſick in ſoul, void of that healthful ſpirit of grace in Chriſt, who were, are, or ever ſhall be, thou art the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per inlet of deſtruction unto them all.</p>
            <p>Yea, all for whom Chriſt died, or <hi>all in whom Chriſt dyes,</hi> that is<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> all in whom Chriſt dies in regard of all the operations of his Spirit, he is dead in them, and therefore he thus adds, <hi>when ye ſin thus againſt your brethren ye ſin againſt Chriſt,</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:40942:13"/>
that is, ye are not the Authours of deſtruction of ſuch as are near creatures, but ye are the Authours of the death and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction of the Son of God in, and unto, your ſelves, and all that depend on this Knowledge, in whom the life of his Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit hath no being, neither takes it place being tendred unto you. Whence our Apoſtle infers, <hi>If meat offend my brother,</hi> that is, if communicating in the word of God carnally, be the deſtruction of the Brother-hood, as that (ſacrifices offered by <hi>Cain</hi> carnally was) <hi>I will not eat fleſh while the world ſtands that I may not offend my brother,</hi> that is, I will not commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicate carnally in the word and worſhip of God unto eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, that ſo I may not deſtroy, but ſave that brother-hood kinded and alyed in Chriſt; as if he ſhould ſay, I will vindi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate and cleare the ſtate of the Goſpel in the word and wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip of God; ſo as never carnal or tranſitory thing was brought in by God to contribute, neither in point of being, nor of beauty, from the firſt to the laſt, from the original unto the end thereof.</p>
            <p>And from this our Apoſtle proves himſelf to be an Apoſtle or Leader, and examplary by another manner of knowledge, and Miniſtry, according to that knowledge and wiſdome which tranſcends the knowledge of all the Idolathites in the world: opened and manifeſted unto us in the nineth Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter: Which he firſt propounds unto us in a four-fold inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogation.</p>
            <p>Verſ. 1. <hi>Am I not an Apoſtle?</hi> Wherein is firſt magnifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal challenge, given to all falſe Apoſtles, or Leaders in that way of Idolatry, to bring in all their allegations to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, and they ſhall ſee them all fruſtrate, and of no value, except to convince and condemn themſelves thereby.</p>
            <p>Secondly, A tryumphant interrogation or confirmation hereof unto all the Saints, who can bring in their teſtimony and be as ſo many witneſſes of the truth hereof, being led by the ſame ſpirit, and therefore eye-witneſſes of the ſame thing.</p>

Verſ. 2. <hi>If I be not an Apoſtle to others,</hi> or in others, that is, Affirmatively; I am not a leader in that way of the Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lathite, which ſits in the carnal and idolatrous Temple, as the Authour of deſtruction and leader thereunto: <hi>Yet doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs I am unto you,</hi> that is, there is no queſtion or ſcruple to be made of it; but the wiſdom wherein I expreſs my ſelf, is the very Authour of, and Leader of you unto ſalvation; which he confirms by argument and divine reaſonings: <hi>For ye are the ſeal of mine Apostleſhip;</hi> that is, there is not any thing which paſſeth out of the Office of mine Apoſtleſhip, but it is under the very Prints and Characters wherein the word of God hath impreſſed and formed it ſelf in your proper eſtate and condition by Chriſt in this our Lordſhip and Authority: So that a true Miniſter of Chriſt hath the witnes of the Saints of God in all ages of the world for the confirmation of the verity and authority of his Miniſtry, which is, <hi>That great cloud of witneſs which compaſſeth every Saint of God, cauſing them to cast away every thing that preſſeth down, and which hangeth ſo f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

            <p>Whereas the Saints of God are of the ſame Office and Dignity, under the ſame Seal and Authority, for there is not one of them but witneſſeth the ſame good confeſſion before

            <p>My defence then, <hi>is this:</hi> that is to ſay; the ſequel of this Chapter, or of this whole epiſtle.</p>
            <p>To prove therefore that mine apoſtleſhip ſtands not upon carnal principles, as the miniſtry of all falſe apoſtles doth, but upon ſuch as are ſpiritual and heavenly, I interrogated in the ſequel of the Chapter, wherein are involved ſo many effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctual and undeniable arguments, affirmations and concluſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, which are without all gainſayings of any falſe apoſtle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip or miniſtry.</p>

his feet, he being Lord over them all and not tied or bound unto any of them, but the ſpirit of God gives the relation of the law of God in all reſpects as it ſtands between God and man, whether as it comes down from God, or goeth up unto God, elſe no proper law of God and of Chriſt.</p>
            <p>The law of God therefore conſiſts of relation between God and man in all things that are proper thereunto, elſe the law of God would ſuffer loſs in the Saints when they ceaſe to converſe with theſe terrene things, but one jot or title of the law ſhall never fail; for it is the Spirit of Chriſt, the Son of eternity, which only fulfils the law in every reſpect and relation.</p>
            <p>He therefore, what ever he be, that concludes the free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, liberty, power, authority, peace or plenty of the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel, to conſiſt in tranſitory eating, drinking, marrying, gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving in marriage, in any bodily labour, or ceſſation and reſt, in tithes, ſtipends, contributions, or uppermoſt ſeats in the aſſemblies and ſynagogues<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that man propounds a carnal go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel to the world, which is not another goſpel; but it is the goſpel perverted ond carnallized, wherein ſalvation did ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver conſiſt, but onely the ſtate of the Curſe, although it may be brought in, as by an angel from heaven in point of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane wiſdom and Eloquence, according to the judgement of humane reaſon viewing it.</p>
            <p>For ſuch fruits as we look to receive, as the proper privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges and crop of the goſpel, ſnch ſeed we ſow, and of ſuch nature is the goſpel which we preach, if we expect any earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and carnal priviledge, as a fruit wherein the authority or the reward of glad tidings doth conſiſt, then do we preach from an earthly and carnal root and principle, the very ſtate of death, and not that ſtate of life which is by Jeſus Chriſt.</p>

It is taken for granted that he doth not, as the conſent of all, for a ſouldier is to be maintained by him who hath choſen him to be a ſouldier; to ſet him at liberty from the intangle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of this life, that ſo all his ſtrength care and courage
<pb facs="tcp:40942:16"/>
may be imployed in purſuit of the adverſary: If then we be ſouldiers of God in Chriſt, it is the things of God which are durable, that defray our charges, and are our livelyhood and maintainance, and not the things of the creature, which pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh and come to nought; if the weapons of our warfare be ſpiritual and not carnal, then is our war alſo ſpiritual and not carnal, and then ſuch is the booty and ſpoil we purchaſe unto our ſelves to live upon in all the accomplices thereof: for if we conquer and overcome ſin and death, Righteouſs and Life is the only riches which preſents it ſelf unto us: if we vanquiſh ignorance and errour, then is the light and ſtreight way of the Lord our great advantage; and if we ſubdue hatred and enmity, then the love of God ſhed abroad in our hearts is our only Booty and bounteous reward.</p>
            <p>And be that expects mens labours and eſtates, favour and reſpect of worldly men for preaching, that man will alſo ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect their perſons and lives for booty in caſe of his own ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage: and his doctrine ſhall be moulded into ſuch a form as may attain thereunto, for it is an eaſie thing in point of carnal reaſon, to make a man a ſinner, ſo as a carnal law ſhall take away his life, and ſo by carnalizing the law of God, they can make Chriſt a blaſphemer, an enemy unto Ceſar, and ſubject to the ſentence o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> their law unto death: many a man had never loſt his life by the hand of the magiſtrate, if a car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal prieſthood had not preach'd him to death; <hi>but God will bring to perdition them that ſpeak a ly, the man of Bloods and deceit.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>We conclude then, that he who frames a law for carnal wages for warring the warfare of the goſpel, that man wars carnally and diabolically in all the deſignes he is put upon.</p>
            <p>The ſecond query to illuſtrate and confirm this point, <hi>who plants a vineyard an eats not of the fruit thereof,</hi> that is<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> he eats of the ſame proper fruit which the ſame vine brings forth which he planteth, and not another fruit in kind, or the fruit of another vine; if we plant a vine, it is the fruit of that vine of fatneſs which doth rejoice the heart of God and man, which we expect and look for, and not the fruit of the bramble, or any inferiour tree of the woods; if we plant
<pb facs="tcp:40942:17"/>
Iſrael that Noble vine, as one who as a prince prevails with God, or the vins Chriſt the Son, whoſe father is the husband<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, we expect only the fruits of righteouſneſs and peace to ſpring up unto us, as the proper vintage and harveſt of ſuch husbandry, even the virtues of him that hath called us out of darkneſs into his marvellous light: Such are the fruits which the planters of that vine of the goſpel do only ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect, and not the apples of <hi>Sodom</hi> nor the grapes of <hi>Gomor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rah,</hi> things of another nature and kind then that which we plant: ſuch as are the tithes, ſtipends, and beggerly rudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of this world, which mortal men by worldly wealth and humane power and pollicies, may indue us with, but for concluſion of this: If we make momentany and mortal things our priviledges in preaching the goſpel, it is a mortall and deadly word we bring unto the ſons of men, and not that goſpel of life and peace which is by Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
            <p>The third point in the interrogation, <hi>doth any man feed a flock <gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>nd not eat of the milk of the flock?</hi> which hath in it a ſtrange affirmation that no man doth, and what doth the man feed and nouriſh the lambes of the flock with all, but with the ſame milk which the flock afordeth, ſo that the lambes are not fed with one kind of food and himſelf with another, but it is the ſame milk which nouriſheth the one and the other: if therefore we lay out the breſts of the conſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations of that Jeruſalem that is above, which is the mother of us all, that men may milk out and be delighted with the brightneſs of her glory, which is that ſincere milk of the word, which onely brings to the growth and perfection of the Son of God, then we never expect to be fed (as a pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledge of the goſpel) with any other thing whatſoever, but only with the ſame milk wherewith the flock of God is fed, which floweth out as rivers and ſtreams to noutiſh them, not in temporary, but in an eternal life, not with the tithes and trumperies, which the prieſthood of this world is ſo wedded unto, only in that unity of the harlot, by adulterating the holy word of God, to bring forth ſuch a carnal and Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtardlike brood, which is nothing elſe (as it is mentioned in adulterating the word of God to lay claim thereunto) but
<pb facs="tcp:40942:17"/>
that price of a whore which is abominable unto the Lord, as never to be brought into his Sanctuary. And it is the law that ſaith theſe things, namely, that injunction, which coupleth God and man together to be one, and not man to any of the creatures, where that ſpirit of conjunction is not on both ſides, for ſo the law is written with the finger or ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of God on both ſides of the tables.</p>
            <p>Therefore he brings in reaſon to confirm the interrogati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, as alſo an inlet to a further argument, viz. <hi>For it is writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten in the law of Moſes,</hi> verſ. 9. that is, it is ingraven in all mens hearts univerſally, to grant the truth of this threefold interrogation; in all carnal men, in whom Moſes is vailed, where the end of the law is not ſeen, which is the miniſtry of condemnation, there it is written, for all men who preach carnally they look for, and expect a return in carnal things, even as a Merchant looks for his return by ſea ſutable to his adventure, and alſo all men who learn or underſtand carnally, they have a conſcience to contribute carnal things, to him who is their teacher, for the labourer (by all men) is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded to be worthy of his hire. Again, as Moſes goes into the tabernacle to have converſe with God, or <hi>turns into the Lord</hi> (as our Apoſtles phraſe is) where the vale is taken a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way, there is in graven in that heart converſing with God face to face, this doctrine in the truth and verity of it, that is, he who miniſters, ſpirituall, holy, and eternal things as the truth is in Jeſus, he looks for return in the ſame kind as the only liberty and plenary priviledge of the goſpel, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pects not elſe, as any return of the goſpel, but only as things may be uſed as ſubſervant to the liberty and return of it.</p>
            <p>So alſo he that is taught in the word and learned ſpiritual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, freely makes him that teacheth partaker of all his goods, that is, there is not a tittle of the wealth, priviledge, and <hi>ſtate</hi> of the Son of God that he can withhold or keep back from him by whom he is taught, in any thing, according to the nature, truth, and verity of the Kingdom of God; but freely yields all unto him that teacheth which himſelf hath learned, and is bleſſed withall, becauſe he cannot part thoſe goods wherewith he himſelf is inriched.</p>

            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:40942:19"/>
And ſhall we think that a Chriſtian which cannot with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold any of thoſe bleſſed priviledges proper to the Son of God from his brother, but freely communicates them all with him: Shall that heart ſo a price of any private intereſt, as to withhold it from his brother, in the ſeaſon thereof, ſhall he freely communicate in the greater and not in the leſs, ſhall he communicate in thy crown, and not in thy grind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at the mill; verily that baſe ignorance of your Sonſhip unto God, through a carnali miniſtry, is the proper ground of all ſuch ſuſpition, as alſo the onely cauſe of ſuch hugging of private intereſts, and preſerving them as ſuch treaſures uuto our ſelves.</p>
            <p>Again, we ſee that the law of God is ſaid here to be the law of Moſes, ſo that God honours his people, as being the Authors of his law, through that unity that is between God and man in the faith of Chriſt, as though man were the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per contriver of the law of God and the giver out and O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riginal of the word of eternity; therefore our Apoſtle is bo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>d with reſpect to the reſt of the Apoſtles and holy men of God, to call it our goſpel, where it is ſaid, <hi>if our goſpel be hid it is hid to them that are loſt;</hi> and again, <hi>our goſpel came not unto you in word onely, but in power and in the holy ghoſt and in much aſſurance.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>And again,</hi> in the day when God ſhall judge the ſecrets of men by Jeſus Chriſt, according to my goſpel: <hi>and again,</hi> now to him that is of power to eſtabliſh you according to my goſpel, and the preaching of Jeſus Chriſt according to the mistery which was kept ſecret ſince the world began; <hi>and again</hi> Remember that Jeſus Chriſt of the ſeed of David was raiſed up from the dead according to my goſpel: <hi>and again,</hi> our word toward you was not yea and nay; <hi>and again,</hi> if any man obey not our word by this epiſtle, note that man, and have no company with him that he may be aſhamed.</p>
            <p>Yea, it is indifferently expreſſed in Scripture, through this unity of faith, to be the law of the Lord, or of his ſervant Moſes; and from this ground it is ſaid, <hi>the people feared the Lord, and they believed in the Lord, and in his ſervant Moſes;</hi> for ſo the words are truly rendred.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:40942:19"/>
We conclude then, that Gods Saints are honoured as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Authour of that, namely his word or law, which is the framer, maker, and conſervatour of all things: it is written or recorded in Moſes law, and here the record is an inlet un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a further argument, to declare the truth of a ſpiritual and ſaving miniſtry: the record is this. <hi>Thou ſhalt not muzzle the mouth of the ox that treadeth out the corn<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> By treading out the corn we are to underſtand, both the manuring of the ground in the fitting of it for the ſowing of the ſeed, and the caſting of the ſeed into the earth, and alſo the treading of the corn out by the feet of the ox, or turning the wheel upon it, to manifeſt the increaſe, as the words following do declare. In the ſowing of the ſeed he is not to have his mouth tied up, or any means uſed to terrifie him, or any way to prevent him from eating of the ſame ſeed that is ſown; and therefore it is contrary to the law to feed him with any other grain, or kinds of meat in the time of his labour, one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly that which ſown by his labour, is the proper and only food appointed for him by the law to eat.</p>
            <p>For, as he ſubdues the ground, ſo as it brings not forth its natural ornaments, ſo he is to feed on the ſeed ſown, which is to take root downwards therein, and bring forth fruit up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards of another kind, then otherwiſe it would naturally have brought forth. Now the goſpel of the Kingdom, or miniſtry of the word of God, doth not plow up the fallow ground of the heart, to ſubdue mens outward eſtates, but only the weeds of corruption which ſpring up from that law of ſin and death; neither is their outward things its refreſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in ſo doing (no more then the ox is to feed of any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther food but that which is ſown in his labour, even ſo the word of life and immortality, the ſame word which we di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtribute, and cauſe to fall as Manna among Iſraels tents, that is the ſame which a true labourer in Gods husbandry ever feeds upon) and it is his proper livelyhood to be exerciſed therein, and ſhall a man be hired to feed himſelf, it is natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral and delightful for all other creatures ſo to do, and ſhall the man of God become ſo mercinary as to be hired to do it; what a ſhame is this Judas Iſcariot-like ſpirit unto the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel
<pb facs="tcp:40942:20"/>
of God: thoſe ſluggards of the world that refuſe to put their hand to their mouth to feed on that which they would have the world to believe is their only food and live<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyhood, but as others lift it up by outward eſtates, and gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving them honour together therewith.</p>
            <p>But there is no doctrine which the man of God teacheth to any man, of what place, office, rank, or degree ſoever he is, but himſelf is concerned in it, ſo as he feeds upon it, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther as it is the breaking of the head of Leviathan, which became meat for the people in the wilderneſſe, and ſo he feeds on his deliverance therefrom, or elſe he is inveſted in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the ſame thing which he teacheth, and ſo it becomes his food and one real ſubſtance with him, and to fall ſhort of this is to carnally the ſeed of life, the word of the Kingdom bounding it to perſons, places, and times, which is to have the word of God in reſpect of perſons; but the man of God finds ſufficient food in whatſoever he ſoweth or laboureth in, and cannot himſelf live without it in the diſtribution thereof; for multiplication and increaſe, and a good hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band man needs no hire to ſow his own field.</p>
            <p>Verſ. 10. <hi>Doth God take care for oxen, or ſaith he it for our ſakes only, for our ſakes no doubt.</hi> In theſe words is a two fold interrogation, and an effectuall anſwer, the firſt part of the interrogation hath in it a ſtrong negation, in theſe words, <hi>doth God take care for oxen?</hi> that is to ſay, it is not oxen whom this care doth concern, or the ſpeech intends. The ſecond part contains a forceable affirmation, <hi>or ſaith he it for our ſakes onely,</hi> that is, the miniſters of Chriſt are they which it only intendeth, and the anſwer takes away all ſcru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples or queſtion, either in the negation or affirmation, in theſe words, <hi>for our ſakes no doubt:</hi> that is, without all con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſie it is the Saints of God, who under the term or name of oxen, labouring, are here meant; the ſame ſpirit who ſpeaks it doth faithfully expound it.</p>
            <p>Whence we are taught, that there is not any thing what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever taken up or aluded unto the Scriptures, or Writings of the word of God, in the expreſſion of the will or works of God, that is or can be of any profitable or right uſe un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
<pb facs="tcp:40942:20"/>
the ſons of men, until it be brought unto, and termina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in, the Man of God, that is to ſay, in Chriſt Jeſus, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther as he is crucified or riſen, it is not oxen the Scripture Intends, it is only, or altogether, us; and the ſame may be as trnly ſaid in any other things wherein the Scripture ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſeth it ſelf in heaven or in earth, brought forth in the creation, generation, art<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> or by putrifaction.</p>
            <p>And for all other skill or learning, if I had all knowledge, could ſpeak with the tongues of men and angels; if I had the gift of propheſie, and underſtood all miſteries, and though I had all faith ſo as to remove mountains, and though I gave all my goods to the poor, and my body to be burned, all is nothing without this manner of knowledge: for it is as true in this point as it is in the point of love, and in the former Chapter where our Apoſtle ſets in oppoſition the true knowledge of the word, and that which is proper to an Idolathite, he transforms the true knowledge into love; ſaying, that Idolatrous knowledge puffs up, but love ſaith he (meaning true knowledge) edifies, ſo that true knowledge edifies not but in love, or knows not but in love, and love knows not it ſelf but in that which is beloved, proſtrating it ſelf unto the ſervice thereof, contrary to Idolatrous know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge that puffeth up.</p>
            <p>And if I have not this art in my knowledge to bring all things unto, and terminate them in the man of God, I am but as a founding braſs which gives no true diſtinct<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               <hi>It is for our ſakes no doubt it is written,</hi> or it is <hi>tranſlated,</hi> that is, out of the Original copies compoſed and recorded unto our glory forever: for it is not the voice of the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tour ſimply and alone conſidered, but of a creature alſo, elſe the record is not full, neither is it the voice of a man ſimply conſidered, but the of the Son of God, otherwiſe the wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting is not perfect, and they who have this voice ſhall live, and whoſoever ſhall read this writing is bleſſed.</p>
            <p>Now the end why a true miniſter of the goſpel lives only upon that which he diſpenceth, is, <hi>that he that ploweth may
<pb facs="tcp:40942:21"/>
plow in hope,</hi> that is, whoſoever tilleth, manureth, or ſtirreth the ground to the ſubduing of its natural and earthly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perties, <hi>may till it in hope,</hi> namely, in undoubted truſt and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence, that the ſeed of immortality ſhall take places, and ſpring up therein unto an abundant multiplication and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe; becauſe in his labour he knows both the nature of that which is ſubdued, as alſo that which reviveth and ſpring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth up, becauſe his ſtrength whereby he conquours is exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſed in the one, and his joy in which he triumpheth conſiſts in the other, wherein there is reſt and feaſtivity through ſpoils, ſufficient for a ſouldier of Chriſt to live upon, and true planter or feeder of a flock to be fully ſatisfied with, without ſeeking after other mens temporary things.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>And he that threſheth in hope, may be partake of his hope,</hi> that is, he that beats out the ſeed of life, by the skilful la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour of love in the right handling of the word of God, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the proper multiplication thereof, according to that infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nit, and profound rooting of it, in that unmeaſureable hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milliation of the Son of God, and aſſured hope of a true and skilful ſeeds man, which hope is a preſent demonſtration and poſſeſſion, of things which alſo are not yet ſeen but to come, becauſe of the eternity of them; which expectation cannot have leſs then an infinite increaſe for the object of it, becauſe the ſeed hath an infinit and eternal life and virtue in it; and therefore it brings forth in ſome thirty fold, in ſome ſixty fold, and in ſome an hundred fold, which is not to be taken gradually, as in ſome more and ſome leſs, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the ſpirit of God inverts the order: for <hi>Luke</hi> begins with thirty fold, and ends with an hundred fold; but <hi>Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thew</hi> begins with an hundred fold, and ends with thirty fold, to declare that it is not a divers increaſe, as applied to divers perſons; but they are all found in the ſame ſubſiſtance, three times ten is the fulneſs and perfection of increaſe, which is only found in the ſeed of God without any defect; three times twenty is the duplication of thirty, which is a twofold perfection, that is, of perfection of life in the ſeed, and a perfection of death unto all things which might tend to the annoyance of the growth and increaſe thereof, and a hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
<pb facs="tcp:40942:21"/>
fold in Scripture Language is innumerable, which can ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver be counted nor told over to find an end of the ſum of the increaſe; which threſhing in the hope of ſuch increaſe and fulneſs of meaſure, preſſed down and running over, in being made partaker of it, is a plenary, plentiful, and ſufficient maintainance for every man of God, without any looking for of other manner of means, as being any liberty, autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, or priviledge, properly appertaining or belonging to the preaching of the goſpel.</p>
            <p>Verſ. 11. <hi>If we have ſown unto you ſpirituall things, a great thing if we ſhall reap your carnal things;</hi> as if he ſhould ſay, if we have diſtributed and laid out upon you, ſpiritual, durable, and eternal things: is there any propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of recompence found in any thing that is carnal what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever (in the return) which fade, periſh, and paſs away in the uſe of them; and doth not equity and juſtice require, that whatſoever is given out in point of exchange, that which is received any way, as in lieu thereof, ſhall hold correſpon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency in weight, worth, and valluation therewith, elſe the law of the relation of the contract is broken, which the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of the kingdome of God admits not of; and therefore no carnal or temporary thing returned whatſoever, can an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer the end of Gods law in this point, for the diſtribution and publication of thoſe ſpiritual and eternal things of the goſpel unto the ſons of men.</p>

greater things, &amp; not voluntarily contribute the leſs, as things of no account or eſteem, with reſpect to the excellencies of them that periſh not, we ſhould villifie the grace of God, if we ſhould ſo think: for the goſpel is of a more tranſcendent nature, then to lay a bond upon any carnal thing, to contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute unto it, or to ſtand in relation with it in any reſpect; for then it would ſuffer loſs in the vaniſhing thereof: but the Son of God, who is the ſubject matter of the goſpel, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not poſſibly ſuffer any abatement in any thing, no nor any thing, no nor at any time, for true Chriſtianity conſiſts not in any bodily exerciſe, and therefore ſuffers no abatement or loſs, while the body ſleeps in the duſt, no more then it doth while the body ſo often ſleeps naturally in this preſent life. <hi>Nevertheleſs we have not uſed this power;</hi> that is, we have not accuſtomed our ſelves to lay claim to any ſuch carnal right or intereſt as falſe apoſtles do, nor to receive any ſuch vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntary contributions from you for our maintainance, as the authority of the goſpel produceth<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> in ſuch as are indued with the life and ſpirit of it, ſo as to refrain labour our ſelves to live upon the pains and labours of others, but have laboured with our own hands.</p>

            <p>But we bear them up, even all the wants and neceſſities of this preſent life, wearing them as our crown, rejoicing under them, and in them all we become conqueronrs; yea, more then conquerours, through him who hath loved us: and to this end we ſuffer them<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> namely, <hi>lest we ſhould hinder the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel of Chriſt,</hi> for the goſpel is hindred from its fruitful and ſucceſsful progreſs, when, and in whomſoever any private intereſt is brought in as any priviledge thereof, for the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel contains that common ſalvation, which is alike proper
<pb facs="tcp:40942:23"/>
and peculiar to every Saint of God, without any reſpect of perſons; ſo that to bring in any thing as appertaining unto to it, which every Saint hath not alike intereſt in, and that in all ages, is to bring in a private intereſt, as a thing apper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining to the goſpel, which is not beſeeming, nor can it be compactable to the ſtate of Chriſt in the goſpel, whether the bodily maintainance or any temporary inſtitution or a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment; bnt is a ſtoppage and hindrance of the free courſe and ſucceſs of the goſpel, and that by intangling of mens hearts to think meanly of the grace of the goſpel, as a carnal and earthly thing: which is only ſpiritual and hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly, in whatſoever appertains and belongs unto it, that doctrine of private intereſts and temporary inſtitutions, to be a priviledge of the goſpel, is the proper ſnare of Satan, laid and hid privily in all ages under the letter of the Scripture, to delude and deceive the world: for if Chriſt were a private intereſt in any Saint, in any particular whatſoever, he could not be the Son of God; becauſe in whomſoever he appears he muſt hold proportion with the father, which could not be if Chriſt were more in one of the Saints then is in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: Such doctrine therefore that maintains private intereſts to be any part of the priviledgc of the goſpel, ſuch doctrine prohibits the Son of God, forbidding him to be that which indeed he is, and ever was and will be, onely a holy uſe of all things in their proper time and ſeaſon; is a priviledge of the goſpel, for to the clean all things are clean.</p>

            <p>
               <hi>For neceſſity is laid upon me:</hi> neceſſity is twofold, firſt in point of want and penury, as if I ſhould ſay, I am deſtitute and ſtripped of all humane and carnal glory and excellencie, ſuch as the carnal Jew adorns himſelf with, unto the put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of Chriſt to death; of which ſtock I naturally come, as I am made of the duſt of the earth, for by nature we are the children of wrath even as others, ſo that neceſſity is up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on me to exclude all boaſting, for I am laid waſte and empty of all glory humane, as the ſpirit of God hath breathed up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on it, and made it to appear to be vanity even as graſs.</p>
            <p>So alſo by nature conſidered in my anceſtours the carnal Jew, I am deſtitute of the glory and virtue of the Son of God, for it is impoſſible that a creature ſimply conſidered, ſhould have any of thoſe virtues and properties peculiar to the creatour, as an eternal ſalvation and life, my neceſſity in that point alſo ſtands in an utter devaſtation of all divine good; yet is my neceſſity in point of being laid waſt of all the wiſdome and glory of the creature, the proper and only capacity, for the reception injoyment and exerciſe of all thoſe eternal and unſearchable treaſures proper only to the ſon of God.</p>
            <p>Secondly, there is a neceſſity of urgency and conſtraint, ſo as the things of God are of that plenty, virtue, and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that they inforce, and conſtrain unto the devulging and
<pb facs="tcp:40942:26"/>
promulgation thereof, therefore it is ſaid, that the kingdom of heaven ſuffers violence, and the violent take it by force, for the things of the kingdome of God, in whomſoever they pleaſe to convent themſelves as an Original fountain and well-head, and from thence to diſtribute and diſpence themſelves as a living ſpring; there can be no more ſtoppage made in the outlet, and diſperſing of them abroad, then there can be any prevention of their inlet and reception into the places appointed for them; for as it was in the beginning when no dry land appeared, or as in caſe of the deluge when the waters covered the earth, the ſpirit of God teſtifies, that they went up by the mountains, and down by the valleys, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the place which God had appointed for them, even ſo it is in this caſe, neither way of aſcention nor yet of diſcention can hinder the Spirit of God, thoſe waters of the Sanctuary, from the proper place appointed for their abode: therefore he ſaith,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>And wo is unto me,</hi> (or as the word is) <hi>wo is in me if I preach not the goſpel:</hi> this word, <hi>wo,</hi> is a phraſe wherein the tenure of the curſe is expreſſed, ſignifying a ſtate moſt baſe, trod upon as being beneath all things that ever God made, having in it a deprivation of all good that ever God placed in the creature, whereof the Image of the creatour is the ſum; therefore an utter loſs and departure of all good toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with the ſucceſſion, and real poſſeſſion of all evils, as houlding proportion in way of Antitheſis in all points with that Image and goodneſs of God which is loſt, which can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be leſs then of an infinit and eternal extent, which is the ground and Original of all vexation and penalty in that way of eternal death. And the not preaching of the goſpel is accompanied with them both, namely, the loſs of God and all goodneſs, for he only is good, and the poſſeſſion of all evil, which in that loſs inevitably ſucceeds; for according to the goodneſs of a thing, loſt, ruinated, or perverted through our own default; ſuch is the evil that ſucceeds, this being written in all mens hearts; therefore men proportion pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhments for offenders, as they judge of the nature of the fact, wherein they preach a greater point then themſelves
<pb facs="tcp:40942:26"/>
are aware of, it is well if it prove not condemnatory to themſelves, for the mind without knowledge is not good: Our Apoſtle therefore concludes, by transferring this <hi>wo</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to himſelf in a figure, as he ſaith in another caſe of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf and <hi>Apollo,</hi> thereby teaching the proper ſtate of the falſe apoſtles in their practiſe, I ſay herein he concludes, that ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation doth conſiſt only in the preaching of the goſpel, as neceſſarily and abſolutely as it doth conſiſt in faith; for there is nothing that is a grace of the goſpel, but hath in it the compleat and full eſtate and condition of Jeſus Chriſt, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out which no ſalvation.</p>
            <p>For as the whole law in all points is fulfilled in one word, namely love, ſo is ſalvation comprehended in every virtue that is in Chriſt, whereof the revelation and opening of the mind of the Father is one.</p>
            <p>And as it is true that he who breaks one commandment is guilty of all, even ſo he that excludes any Chriſtian from a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny one grace or virtue that is in Chriſt, he excludes him from all; for as it is true that with the heart man believes unto righteouſneſs, even ſo, with the mouth confeſſion (which is preaching) is made unto ſalvation, and the one is as ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary unto life as the other, for he that confeſſeth not, or he that preacheth not, that Chriſt is come in the fleſh is An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichriſt, and Antichriſt is that ſon of perdition, or deſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and not of ſalvation.</p>
            <p>Every Chriſtian therefore is to witneſs a good confeſſion, or is to witneſs a good preaching, as befnre <hi>Pontius Pilate,</hi> or elſe no attaining unto ſalvation, that is, every Chriſtian muſt with boldneſs and courage oppoſe the virtue and power of the Son of God, againſt all the rulers of the darkneſs of this world, which is of that evil one<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
            </p>
            <p>This <hi>wo,</hi> therefore pronounced, againſt falſe apoſtles, in this figurative ſpeech of the Apoſtle; as transferring it unto himſelf, reſts upon all ſuch in its real abode, as either preach not the goſpel according as the truth is in Jeſus, and ſimpli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city thereof in the reſt, or elſe neglect it, or forbid it to be preached by others, or in themſelves; for they may as well neglect, or deny to themſelves or others, the faith of Gods
<pb facs="tcp:40942:27"/>
elect, or any virtue and grace appertaining to life and ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; therefore our Apoſtle (in whom is perſonated all true and faithful Saints of God) is neceſſitated hereunto, and doth it by conſtraint, even as the love of Chriſt conſtraineth him to deal faithfully and plainly in the cauſe o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> God, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the demonſtration and evidence of the Spirit of God in the ſalvation of his choſen, though the falſe apoſtles judged him to be beſides himſelf in ſo doing, therefore it follows,</p>
            <p>Verſ. 17. <hi>For if I do it willingly,</hi> that is, if I do it volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarily of my own accord, by any will or law of a creature, conſtraining and urging me thereunto, <hi>then I have a reward,</hi> that is, ſuitable to the fountain from whence it comes, which is the will of a creature, which Chriſt never came to do, nor to be in motion thereby; but only to do the will of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and from that to receive motion in all his enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prizes.</p>
            <p>Or thus, then I have my reward, or <hi>my end,</hi> as the word imports, that is if I preach from a humane will<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> my end is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo humane; if I preach from the learning and abillities of a creature, it is the obtaining of the things of the creature, which I propound as my aim and end therein, and not the things of God, my main ſcope and intent is ſo fading and periſhing <hi>Mammon of unrighteouſneſs</hi> and not the durable treaſure conſiſting in that righteouſneſs of God through the faith of Jeſus.</p>
            <p>For according to the nature of the ſpirit which goeth forth, ſuch is the nature of the thing expected and looked for in the return, and ſuch it ever proves to be, for he that ſows to or in the fleſh ſhall of the fleſh reap corruption, but he that ſows in the ſpirit ſhall reap everlaſting life, a car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal miniſtry ever expects carnall things, and an expectation of carnal things for preaching the word of God, is an evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent demonſtration of a carnal and corrupt miniſtry, not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable in the houſe of God or in any Chriſtian heart, for it never knew what the liberties and priviledges of the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel are; and therefore can never utter them.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>But if I do it againſt my will,</hi> that is, againſt the will and

proper law of man, which is at enmity againſt God, for it is not ſubject to the law of God neither indeed can be, as this our Apoſtle affirms, in another place, for Chriſt is not brought forth or born of fleſh, nor of bloud, nor of the <hi>will of man,</hi> but of God, as the Scriptures teach, <hi>then is the diſpenſation committed unto me,</hi> as if he ſhould ſay, then the ordering and diſpoſing of all the whole matter of the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel, is committed to me in truſt; as to a Steward, and ſo the glory, excellency, and virtue, in point of the diſpenſati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and diſpoſure thereof, in its going out, as alſo the return, of praiſe, honour, and all due deſerts<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> appertains and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs ſolely unto my Lord, or unto that Lordſhip derived un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to me, (which is never abſtracted from the ſteward) and not unto me as a man, nor to any mortal creatures, who or what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever.</p>

            <p>Verſ. 19. <hi>For though I be free from all men;</hi> in theſe words the Spirit of God in our Apoſtle ſeems to change the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of his ſpeech, in that whereof he treats, transferring that unto himſelf which before he gives to the goſpel, for the liberty of the goſpel he makes here to be his liberty; ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, for though <hi>I be free,</hi> and that I abuſe not <hi>my liberty,</hi> which before he affirms, that it is only the freedome of the goſpel which he labours for, giving us to underſtand hereby, that the Saints of God are the ſubject matter of the goſpel, and not onely the Sainrs of God in general, as that myſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal and univerſal body of Chriſt; but every one in particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar is the ſame ſubject matter<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and of the ſame concernment that the goſpel of God is; for Chriſt cannot be divided, neither can the ſpirit be received by meaſure, nor can one lyne or letter in that book of the covenant be cancelled, but the whole covenant is void and of none effect; ſo that God hath reſpect to his Saints, as collecting all into one, and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtributing one into all, and therefore the whole and every particular are of the ſame concernment.</p>
            <p>So that we cannot teach the true ſtate of one Chriſtian in any reſpect; but we teach the ſtate of the whole body in that reſpect, and we cannot teach the ſtate of the myſtical body of Chriſt, but we teach the ſtate of Chriſt himſelf; and if we preach Chriſt, we preach the goſpel, and if we teach ought elſe as any point or particular of ſalvation, we pervert the goſpel to our ſelves (and all that hear us with approbation) to diſtruction.</p>
            <p>For a true Chriſtian and the goſpel have one and the ſame form, they conſiſt of the ſame matter, they have the ſame ſpirit, and are of the ſame ſpirit, they are of the fame de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree and dignity, and of the ſame reſpect and continuation before God; yea Davids ſeed is as the ſun, that ſure witneſs in heaven, that fai<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

            <p>No man can deſcribe a Chriſtian, but that which he takes his form from muſt appear, which is the goſpel, or form of wholſome words: nor can any man preach the goſpel, or ſet forth that form of wholſome words, but as it, or they give form to a Chriſtian; therefore the freedome of the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel is the freedome of our Apoſtle, and the freedome of an Apoſtle, is the freedome and liberty of the goſpel, or thus (as the word imports) the power and authority of the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel is the proper power and authority of a Chriſtian, and the power and authority of a Chriſtian, is the proper power and authority of the goſpel: <hi>For though I be free from all men,</hi> or from all <hi>things,</hi> as the word will beat without ſtrain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it, as if he ſhould ſay, there is no man or thing that can lay claim unto me, or hath any right or intereſt in me, ſo as to challenge or countermand mine authority as a ſuperin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendent power, being my freedome, is the freedome of the goſpel, the ſubject matter whereof is the Son of God: So that nothing can challenge any title in me, ſave only the ſame ſpirit whereof I am, or the ſame body wherein I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt; becauſe nothing can add any thing to the fulneſs of that one body, nor can be of like nature or conſtitution to be joyned therewith, by any ligament or bond whatſoever: ſo alſo contribute unto me in any reſpect, as having the leaſt deſert, whereby to require any thing at all from me, in way of requital, as its proper right; no, all ſchools of humane learning never contributed any thing, neither unto my be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, nor form (for I received it not from man) neither can

they challenge right or intereſt in any point of doctrine in which I teach, according to the nature and true intent there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, and however it be true that my freedome and authority be ſuch in all particulars.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Yet I have made my ſelf a ſervant to all,</hi> or as the word is, <hi>a minister in all,</hi> that is, I ſerve and miniſter in, or uſher in the word of God, by means of all things in heaven and in earth, being ſuch things which the mind of man can give ſome form unto, whereby the word of God hath made it ſelf ſpeakable unto all the ſons of men, which is the proper end of all Gods works, that the word of bleſſing, and alſo of the curſe, may take place and be eternized, which other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe could not be; for the manner of being, forms, relations, and operations of all the creatures, are ſo many diſhes, char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers, or platters, wherein that food and bread of life (ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantiated only in Chriſt) is preſented unto mankind to feed upon: for there is nothing in all the works of God, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the food of eternal life is not commended unto the world, as being that figure or letter of the Scripture, that great vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lume, or common Library; ſtanding faſt in all ages, and as free to be read by the poor, as the rich, the meaneſt, as the greateſt Potentates in the world.</p>
            <p>Therefore it is ſaid, go and preach the goſpel to every creature, or as the word is, in every creature, that is, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent Chriſt Jeſus unto the world, as in a figure by all things contained therein.</p>
            <p>But the men of the world, like unnatural canibals, or men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaters, or as the Oſtrich, of whom it is ſaid, ſhe can digeſt Iron, falls upon feeding of themſelves with the diſh or plat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter in which the food is brought (which is to paſs away as nothing of that meat fit for the ſon of man to feed on, in the very repreſentation thereof) and in ſo doing, they ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer the bread of life to paſs from them as a thing of nought worth.</p>
            <p>And that wherein the reality of the word of God, is on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſignified unto us as in a figure, is that great engine, which Satan hath ever erected (as that tree, good for food, plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant to the eyes, and to be deſired to make one wiſe) where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by

he hath alwayes inſnared the men of the world, and faſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned the word of the curſe upon them, namely, the things wherein the word of life expreſſeth it ſelf unto mankind; without which it were not ſpeakable to man, no more then it is now unto a brute beaſt.</p>
            <p>Now the end why I thus ſerve or miniſter in all things that viſibly appears, is this, namely, <hi>that I may gain the more,</hi> or that I may gain all; that is, win them by conqueſt, or ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>due all things as ſubſervant, and put under the feet of Jeſus Chriſt (as all things were concluded to be at the firſt) as ſuch things which are no part of the kingdome of God, no more then there could be a helper fit for man, found amongſt them all in the beginning, when the nature and uſe of them all was ſeen, in giuing names unto them accordingly: theſe are all to be gained as by conqueſt, ſubdued, and brought under the feet of the Son of God, as ſubſervant unto him, and that in the very act of ſerving or miniſtring in them, as nothing of that kingdome; which is not of this world, that the truth and reality of all things intimated thereby, may ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear to be realized, ſubſtantiated, and eternized only in Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt that ſon of the living God, who is the fulneſs of him that <hi>filleth</hi> all in all, or is <hi>filled</hi> all in all; for the word is both of active and paſſive ſignification, to ſhew unto us, that in the Son of God, there is both an aptitude to fill, and to be filled, which is that grand grace of the goſpel, in all things, and at all times, in all ages.</p>
            <p>Verſ. 20. <hi>To the Jews I became a Jew,</hi> that is that is to ſuch as ſtand ſtrictly upon pedigree family, the diſtinction of tribes, churches, or congregations of people, Sects and Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minaries, to keep intire, peculiar, and certain, the genealogy of Chriſt, ſo as they may approve of him in his appearance, to be ſuch a one as to whom the promiſe is annexed, to ſuch I deſire no better ground to work upon, or means of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyance of my doctrine for their conviction, whereby to gain by conqueſt, and ſubdue under the feet of Chriſt, all ſuch diſtinctions, anities, relations, and hiſtorical ſeed platts of production, and from theſe humane and Jewiſh princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, to make good and maintain, that all ſuch conjunctions
<pb facs="tcp:40942:30"/>
and propagations, in whatſoever they appear to be holy and acceptable before God, do only conſiſt in Chriſt Jeſus the ſon of God, ſo as they ſhall never end nor alter, in whom only they are real, and in all other reſpects whatſoever they are, empty and vain; for there is no true genealogy of Chriſt ever to be found, according to the real intent of the Spirit of God in the Scriptures, where the parties contract<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to bring forth, and the product or ſeed, are not of the ſame plurality and ſingularity, the one as the other; yea, and of the ſame diſtance with reſpect to the tribes or family, and of the ſame unity and nearneſs of blood: for neither in the conjunction of ſtock, nor yet in the ſimplicity of the product is there any unity of creature, and creature to be conſidered (otherwiſe) then only in way of metaphorical alluſion, and in point of doctrinal reſpects, only the unity and conjuction of the Creatour and the creature, is the matter and form of them both, in all true and ſubſtantial re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects and intents of the word of God, in the intended conſiſtance, without which all are empty void and vain.</p>
            <p>Therefore the true ſtock and family, tribe and kindred, genealogy, and off-ſpring of the Son of God, is as ſtrictly and precizely to be kept &amp; maintained unto this day, as it was to the dayes of the Virgin Mary, to make manifeſt and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm the promiſed ſeed, without which we cannot poſſibly know who is the true inheriter of the promiſes, and ſo are void of the faith of God; which continued act of genea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logy, confounds and bring to nought all literal and traditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onal genealogies of the carnal Jew, confirming the truth to be in Jeſus, and not elſewhere, from the beginning unto this day.</p>
            <p>Which true Sonſhip and off ſpring only, can ſtill utter this voice unto the vain conceits of a carnal Jew, ſo as to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found them, namely, that although it be true that I am the Son of David: yet it is as true, that be one David was I am, and therefore David in ſpirit calls him Lord; which argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment rightly propoſed by Chriſt, as reaſly preſent, is of force to ſtop the mouths of all Jewiſh phariſaical ſcribes and el<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders: again, though he be the ſeed of Abraham, yet can he

            <p>O fools and blind, ſhall we think that the genealogy and off-ſpring of the Son of God ended and was cut off in the Virgin Mary; or that it was more carnal and bodily in onr forefathers then it is in our dayes, is not the fleſh of Chriſt, (though never a carnal and fleſhly Chriſt) conſerved in his off-ſpring until now, ſhall we think this word hath not eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity in it, and is made good in his myſtical body whereever any member thereof appears, viz. <hi>My fleſh is meat indeed, and my blood is drink indeed, and he that eateth not my fleſh, and drinketh not my blood, hath no life in him;</hi> or is this ſpeech worn out ſo, as that it comprehends not the whole body, viz. <hi>My heart and my fleſh rejoyces in the living God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Is there no more mention to be made of this word: <hi>My ſoul thirſteth for thee, my fleſh longeth greatly after thee, is a land of drought:</hi> Such as lay theſe things aſide, and count it blaſphemy to ſay Chriſt is compleatly preſent in his Saints in theſe dayes, in the reallity of whatſoever his body con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſts of, and will but afford him only ſome certain ſpirit, or rather rayes and influences thereof, to be reſident in his Saints; to this end, that the world may not want power to do what they pleaſe with their bodies, theſe men are of that ſpirit of Antichriſt, which deny the coming of Chriſt in the fleſh, as the Spirit of God in his Apoſtle averreth; for if it were ſalvation to confeſs Chriſt come in the fleſh, as born of the Virgin Mary in ſuch an age of the world only, then would that wicked ſea and lake of Rome, have as much ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation in it as thy people at this day extant, who profeſs and deſcribe him in that reſpect<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> by ſo many abominable ſigns and Images: for our Apoſtle affirms, that that ſpirit which confeſſeth that Jeſus Chriſt is come in the fleſh, is of God.</p>
            <p>But this ſpirit which confeſſes Chriſt upon the ſame prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples
<pb facs="tcp:40942:31"/>
that Rome and the reſt of the rabble of the world do, who read the writings of the Apoſtles; they do not acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge the inſufficiency of man, in that alſufficiency of the Son of God, nor that diſability of the creature in point of all humane help, to be born up and carried out, in that ſtrength and deſire proper only to the ſpirit of God.</p>
            <p>In caſe therefore of the Jews in their ſtrictneſs about ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nealogies and pedegrees, I am as a Jew in all ſuch matters, and it is the only doctrine I teach, whereby I find an ear in them to hear, but it is to confound and bring to nought all carnal vain genealogies, tribes, kindreds, and families; as ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving reſpect unto God, that the family and race of the Son of God only may take place of them all, that ſo I may gain them all unto him or vanquiſh and ſubdue them all under him, that the reality of them all may only be found in him, as they are of any truth, holineſs, honour, or of any acce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptation unto, or in any reſpect with God at all, and that all other are but vain and endleſs genealogies, as our Apoſtle calls them.</p>
            <p>Ignorance of this point, in that <hi>obcaeco<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Again, ignorance in this point of the true and compleat proceed of Chriſt, whenever he appears really in any particular perſon or office, is the very ground of that diabollical conceit, that the Spirit of God operates in man here on the earth for a time, and at his death, man, as a creature returns unto the earth both in regard of ſoul and body, and is diſſolved into the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lements whereof natural bodies are made, and compoſed: and that nothing but ſimply God, as an increated being is ſaved, or returns to his ancient center: theſe two opinions ſeem to be far diſtant, but are both alike diabolical, denying the truth and reallity of the Son of God, and are deceivers of mankind, cauſing them to be inamored with, and dore

            <p>
               <hi>To them that are under the law, as under the law:</hi> that is, to ſuch as are under that Ceremonial bond and ingagement, of being tied in the wayes of their worſhips, to perſons, pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, times, and terms of humane relations, as neceſſary parts thereof; inſtituting of churches, creating of officers, ſetting up ſeals, ſigns, &amp; ſervices of time, which in time will vaniſh away: to theſe I declare my ſelf to be under as ſtrict bonds and ingagements as themſelves be, ſo as I move not in heart nor by hand, utterance in tongue, or geſtures and demeanure in carriage. But with reſpect unto this my ingagement, which is the bond of the ſpirit, binding me over unto God, by free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing me from all ingagements and things whatſoever, inferi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our to himſelf in his Son Chriſt, and not the ſpirit of bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage which ingageth unto the creature, as being ſet in the place of the Creatour, which is ever accompanied with trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling and fear, becauſe of the conſcience of the inſufficiency and uncertainty thereof.</p>
            <p>And by taking up theſe their bonds and tranſitory ingage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, whereabout, as ſervants of ſin, they ſpend their time, imploy their ſtudies, exerciſe their zeal, in binding heavy burdens upon themſelves and others, ſeeking reſt by the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment of that unclean ſpirit, but find none, buſying them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in picking at the bark, rinde, husk, or ſhell, and never come to taſte of the pith, marrow, or kernell, and by open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of theſe rudiments, and declaring what they be in their ſtricteſt injunctions, which being followed to the uttermoſt of their intent, in what they drive at and lead unto, which is no leſs; nor fall they ſhort of an impoſſibility to pleaſe God thereby, I do by theſe things bring out the reallity of the law of the Spirit of life, which is in Chriſt Jeſus our Lord, which is the only freedome from this law of ſin and death.</p>
            <p>Which law of God hath all its relations operations and reſpects only in Chriſt, and out of him it neither binds by a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny bond, nor layes it any burden, but hath in it in every reſpect, the liberty, freedome, and authority of the Son of God.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:40942:32"/>
And by this means I gain the truth and verity of all law, bonds, and ingagements, to have their ſubſiſtance and being only in the Son of God, being of the ſame degree, power, and continuation which himſelf is, and ever will be, which is the onely freedome; and therefore the Saints of God are not bound unto, but tranſcend, and are far above all humane and tranſitory things; from which God hath freed them, and ſet them infinitely above them, once and for ever; ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king them Lords over them all, and not as ſlaves to any of them, even as it is ſaid that the Son of man is Lord of the ſubbath, which goes beyond all phariſaical conceptions, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they bow and kneel unto it, as to aged of the continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation of foure and twenty hours.</p>
            <p>Verſ. 21. <hi>To them that are without law as without law:</hi> that is, to ſuch as have a ſpirit, of ſuch liberty, as that they can give themſelves leave to do any thing, never having re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect to any order or ſtrictneſs of converſation, to be injoyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the word of God, but ſtand aloof, and a diſtance, from all ties and ingagements thereby, like the profane Gentiles, with reſpect unto the ſtrictneſs of the Jew.</p>
            <p>To ſuch perſons I preach and profeſs as great liberty and more then they can poſſibly do, as being free from all law, bonds, and ingagements whatſoever, as not being under an abſolute command or prohibition to do, or forbear, any earthly or tranſitory thing, and in opening of this my free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome and authority: I muſt of neceſſity declare how, and upon what grounds I injoy and am poſſeſſed of this liberty; and that is only in becoming one with him who is Lord of all things. So that I acknowledge no bond but what is only found in him, who is both the giver and alſo the receiver of the law; or elſe I preach not Chriſt only, but bring in ſome ſuperfluous thing to joyn with him, which ſacrifice ſo brought, is an abomination unto the Lord. But in him alone, there is fulneſs of freedome and liberty, and out of that freedome there is no true ingagement, according to the law and will of God: neither ever was nor ſhall be, and hereby I bring in all true and lawful relations, according to the mind and intent of God (in all his expreſſions from things tranſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory)
<pb facs="tcp:40942:33"/>
to conſiſt and to be only in Chriſt: And therefore I bring by this means that ſpirit of extravagancy, and licenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous liberty, to yield it ſelf over and become ſubject unto that bond of the Spirit which is in Chriſt Jeſus, wherein all true freedome and authority doth conſiſt in all ſuch as are appointed unto life.</p>
            <p>And this is done by preaching liberty from all carnal and earthly ties, as not being under any law or abſolute ingage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment unto any of them all, further then expedience and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent oportunity calls for, in the proſecution of the work of God; whereby we bring the whole law of God in all points to ſtand in its true relation between God and man, all other things being inferiour, and infinitely to low, to anſwer in point of relation, in the ſpirit and ſtate of a Chriſtian, ſo as to bear a part in the fulfilment of that Royall law of God; which is only fulfilled in us, namely, God and man in the uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of faith, and ſo in every Chriſtian, and in no other re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation whatſoever, no more then man could find a meet help for the production of his kind in all the creatures in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning, but muſt have one as taken out of himſelf, that ſo ſhe might be fleſh of his fleſh and bone of his bone, not only having his nature, but bearing his name and authority aſo, as <hi>Iſh</hi> and <hi>Iſha,</hi> only diſtinct with reſpect to Sex<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as it is in Chriſt in point of Creatour and creature. So that by preaching freedome and liberty from all law in point of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation to things which fade and come to nought, I bring to nought and abrogate that law<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> or ſpirit of bondage, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo gain unto my ſelf that eternal law and ingagement of faith, to conſiſt only and wholly in the Son of God, and therefore he inſerts.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>When I am not without law to God:</hi> Intimating thereby that the true property or form of the law, is, only to face unto God, and not unto any creature, no, not among the Saints themſelves: for the Spirit of God in each other, as it is the Spirit of Jeſus, is the proper object of the bond of relation; ſo that whereſoever a meer creature is made a relative in the law of God, it is the adulterating of the word of God, by that ſpirit of an harlot, and of fornications, as alſo an Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lizing
<pb facs="tcp:40942:33"/>
of the creature, ſetting it in the place of, or bringing it in competition with the Lord: for the Spirit or life of Chriſt, though a man, yet was never deſtitute of the Image, wiſdome, and ſpirit of God; ſo that God had never re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect unto mankind, as in unity and order of his law, but with reſpect to that wiſdome and Image of his own, and not of a meer creature ſimply conſidered.</p>
            <p>Therefore he adds, <hi>But in the law of Chriſt,</hi> or but un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the law, or within the law of Chriſt, that is, I am in, or under that law of the Spirit, as within the bounds and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fines of it in all things, namely, that law of the Spirit of life which is in Chriſt Jeſus our Lord; out of whoſe myſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal body or ſpiritual incorporation, there is not any pieces or part, no not a word or ſyllable of the proper law and will of God, in any of the relations or operations proper thereunto: for if any momentany thing or temporary of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice or relation, ſhould be that whereof any part of the law of God doth conſiſt, then would the law of God ſuffer loſs and detriment, when we part from all temporary relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and things.</p>
            <p>And we may as well affirm, that the almighty ſuffers loſs of his Royal will, and of his being, that which he is, in Chriſt; as to affirm the leaſt diminution of the law in any reſpect, or at any time<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for one jot or tittle thereof ſhall never fail nor paſs away; no, though heaven and earth ſhould paſs away, yet the law of God ſhall never fail.</p>
            <p>Verſ. 22. <hi>To the weak I become as weak;</hi> that is, to them who are deſtitute of the power of godlineſs in the exerciſe of theſe virtues and offices peculiar to Chriſt, to ſuch <hi>I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came as weak;</hi> that is, I preach my ſelf and all fleſh to be ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly inſufficient, and altogether diſabled to move towards God by any ſtrength of the creature, in any way of acce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptation with him, that is to ſay, by means of any humane power or wiſdome, art or abilitie whatſoever: and this uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal inſufficiency of all fleſh, where it is truly ſeen and rightly acknowledged, I preach to be the only capacity of the reception of the Spirit of God, wherein, and through
<pb facs="tcp:40942:34"/>
which, it comes to move upon the mind of man, as it is ſaid to move upon the face of the deep in the beginning; which inſufficiency of the creature, void of the excellencies and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>billities of the Creatour naturely, nor ſeen, nor rightly and groundedly acknowledged, is nothing elſe but that myſterie of iniquity, the depths of Satan: and the devil that great deceiver of mankind, who is the proper fulneſs thereof, therefore he is called the prince of the power of the aire, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe every veſſel not having in it real and ſubſtantial things, or matter wherewith to fill it; there the aire takes place, and is the fulneſs of it, even ſo whereever, and in what heart the real and ſubſtantial things of the Son of God are not, there doth the devil take place, and is the fulneſs of that heart, whatever it be in the judgement of men.</p>
            <p>So that the true acknowledgement of weakneſs I am one with, as it is the only capacity of the fulneſs of the ſpirit of God, in the exerciſe of its virtues, and manifeſtation of the power of God, and not of man: And by this I gain weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, in the true acknowledgement thereof, to conſiſt only in Chriſt the alſufficient ſtrength of God (and is not elſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where to be found) where all inſufficiency muſt of neceſſity flie away; and there only is all true and proper motion in way of holyneſs and honour, whereby the power and glory of God, and not of the creature comes to move upon man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, and manifeſt it ſelf in all his virtues and excellencies whatſoever; and by this means of becoming weak, I gain all weakneſs, or weakneſs to become that alſufficiency and ſtrength of the Son of God, who is able to ſubdue all things unto himſelf, this weakneſs being the proper receptacle and place of the abode, and hiding of his power: So as none but himſelf can find out how to communicate or participate therein: where only he is known in all his particular virtues, goodneſs, and love, in the exerciſe and injoyment thereof forever.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>I am made all things in all men,</hi> or thus, <hi>I am made all men in all things:</hi> that is, there is not any thing wherein the mind of man naturally moves with reſpect to God, or with reſpect to any of the works of God, or wherein any of the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
<pb facs="tcp:40942:34"/>
are in motion towards mankind, or among themſelves; but I make my ſelf a companion therewith, or a ſuting there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto, in point of all operations, relations, and reſpects, and that to this end, that by opening and diſcloſing of my ſelf what I am in any ſuch operation, relation, or reſpect, in point of the reality, ſubſtantiality, and continuation thereof, in the truth and verity of the thing; as countable and of worth in the records of God, I may thereby diſanul and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boliſh and bring to nought, as things of no truth and of no virtue, in whatſoever the natural heart of man moves to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards God and the creature: and alſo in whatſoever man naturally contains, or receives from the motions of God, or the creatures towards himſelf, and make good that<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> all ſuch things come within the confines of that law of the carnal commandement, conſiſting in ordinances which are againſt us, and therefore are nailed unto the croſs of Chriſt, and forever made ſure and intailed only to that carnal and fleſhly ſpirit of the Jew, which ever crucifies the Lord of glory ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Spirit; putting him to open ſhame, or ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king a mock of him: and therefore in the diſanulling and abrogating of all theſe carnal things nailed unto the croſs of Chriſt; I make it plain and manifeſtly to appear, that the ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lid truth and reality of all things conſiſt and have their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per and only being in Chriſt, and out of whom all things are vain and empty, only filled with that ſpirit of cruelty and perſecuting Jew.</p>
            <p>And by this means I ſtrip the world, lay it waſte, and make it vacant of all things whatſoever, that turn to any account or reckoning in the records of God, or that is found writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten in that book of life, wherein all living and acceptable things are written, and the reſt are ſuch as are written in the earth. So that the world hath nothing left to take hold of for any ſtay or ſupport, in which can be any hope or confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence to truſt unto, for there is nothing to be found of ſuch nature or quality, that is not involved within that proper ſtate and real condition of Jeſus Chriſt the Son of the bleſſed.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>That I may by all means ſave ſome:</hi> that is, that I may by
<pb facs="tcp:40942:35"/>
the true controverting of all things, make it apparent and plain, that ſalvation doth conſiſt in every thing, according to that which Gods wiſdome hath ordered, and appointed all things to be and appear in Chriſt; either as he is given as a ranſome, and ſo as loſt or given up unto death in all things that are holy and ſpiritual in the men of the world: in whom nothing of his divine and proper virtue doth appear, or is in being and exerciſed; in which eſtate the reality of all things appertaining to death, are for ever in their heighth of ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration.</p>
            <p>Or elſe as he is the ranſomed from death in his choſen and elect ones, in whom all things of life, righteouſneſs and peace, are in their proper being, virtue, and exerciſe there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of; and ſo in Chriſt, as dead or alive, are all real things of death and life only found: and thus by becoming all things I ſave ſome, or as the word imports, I ſave all, that is, as all things univerſally became death and deſtruction, as Satan orders them, in putting Chriſt to death in all ſpiritual re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects.</p>
            <p>Even ſo all things univerſally become reſurrection and life, as the wiſdome of God orders them, in the mortificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and death of all carnal and ſenſual things in Chriſt, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by the life of God is revived in the ſon of man, in all ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual and eternal reſpects<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and thus all things are deſtroyed and brought to nought by Satan, or by man in his defection from God, which is a univerſal fall of mankind from his Creatour, forever. And it is as true, that all things univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſally are ſaved and confirmed in a ſtate of excellency and perfection, by the reſurrection and aſcention of the Son of man (through that wiſdome of God, into the life and reign of, and in all things, that are proper to God eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally.</p>
            <p>And obſerve, that this death unto all ſpiritual things pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per to the infinite and eternal Son of God, muſt needs be of univerſal comprehenſion, and being alive unto all the things proper to the ſame Son of God, muſt needs be of the ſame univerſal extent; yet it is impoſſible that theſe twain ſhould reſide in one and the ſame individual ſubſtance and being:
<pb facs="tcp:40942:35"/>
and therefore a univerſal eſtate of death, and alſo a univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal eſtate and condition of life, is found in the ſons of men, of one and the ſame extent: becauſe it is of the Son of God, in way of his death, and of his life, that gives latitude and longitude to them both, and therefore a two fold ſtate and condition ſtanding in due oppoſition is found in mankind, and ſhall be forever.</p>
            <p>Verſ. 23. <hi>And this I do for the goſpels ſake,</hi> that is, that I may give all honour and eſtimation unto the goſpel, or un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Son of God; ſo that whatſoever hath in it any worth or dignity, utility or excellency, it is only ſubſtantiated and eternized in the ſubject matter of the goſpel, and not elſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where to be found according to the true and real intent of the word of God: And therefore all things which cannot be ſnmmed up within the account and reckoning of the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel, as being the matter and ſubſtance thereof; or elſe uſed by the wiſdome of the ſpirit thereof, ſo as to conduce to the promoting of the goſpel. I ſay, that all things not of this nature and uſed to this end, namely, to advance and ſet up, as the only and alone thing to be had in honour and eſteema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, the goſpel ſpeech and triumphant act of mans ſalvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on by Chriſt: all things without the compaſs of this account, of what other nature they may be, or of what other na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture they may be, or of what other uſe they may ſeem to ſerve unto, they are left under juſt rebuke, ſhame, reproach, and ignominy, whatever they may ſeem to be in the eſtima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the ſons of men.</p>
            <p>For to become all things for the advances, or for the ſake, or cauſe of one thing, is no leſs then to make that thing, the all in them all, without which they are vain and empty, not coming within the account of real and ſubſtantial things.</p>
            <p>Thence it is that Chriſt ſaith, for their ſakes ſanctifie I my ſelf, that they alſo may be ſanctified, it is for the elects ſake that the Son of God makes himſelf holy, that all the Saints may partake of that holyneſs, now the Son of God is not made <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>oly but in mankind; therefore man is the thing in eſtimation with God, as not being content with an increated
<pb facs="tcp:40942:36"/>
holyneſs in himſelf as God, ſimply conſidered; but is made holyneſs, whereby it becomes communicable to all the Saints, they therefore are the only thing in Gods eſteem, and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>o he is made holy for their ſakes, and the Son of God promoted in the goſpel, is the only thing eſteemed by a true Saint; and therefore he becomes all things, to commend the dignity of the goſpel, yea, Chriſt prefers his flock before his own life, for he layes down life eternally to the wicked, that his ſheep belonging to that one ſheepfold may live eternally in him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf: in whom they die to all carnal and tranſitory things, for the conſervation and exerciſe of the life of the Son of God, which is ſpiritual and not carnal, eternal and not tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitory.</p>
            <p>Hence it is that Daniel prayeth that the Lord will do, and not defer, for his own ſak, preferring the name and authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of God before all things, even as our Apoſtle here makes himſelf all things, that he may terminate all in the goſpel, the reſult whereof follows, namely,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>That I may be partaker of the goſpel with you,</hi> or in you, and you in me, as he ſaith in another place, ye are our epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle written in our hearts, as if he ſhould ſay, we record no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing upon you, but that which we can reade upon our own ſpirit: therefore an enterchangeable act, if you expreſs your ſelves we read you in our ſelves, and if we expreſs our ſelves, you may read us upon your own hearts; ſuch mutual agreement there is in the epiſtle or writings of Chriſt.</p>
            <p>So here, that I may be the co-partners or companions with you in the goſpel, or that we may be that unity and ſubſtantial fellowſhip of the goſpel. The meaning is, that we conſidered together as one myſtical or ſpiritual body, may become thereby the ſubject matter of the goſpel, or of all good ſayings between God and man in Chriſt: For none can deny but the Son of God is the ſubject matter of the goſpel, ever was and ever will be, and it is not Chriſt as one particular holy one of God only, born of the Virgin Mary in ſuch an age of the world: But it is Chriſt conſidered in his myſtical body, that as it is ſaid of the myſterie of the goſpel, where it is deſcribed to be Chriſt in you the hope of
<pb facs="tcp:40942:36"/>
glory, ſo that it may as truly be ſaid here in this caſe, Chriſt in us the ſubject matter of the goſpel; ſo that if we deſcribe and delineate a Chriſtian, really according to his nature and form: we preach the goſpel, and in caſe we preach the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel in the true manner and form thereof, we do neither more nor leſs, but only ſet forth and deſcribe a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian.</p>
            <p>And therefore the Spirit of God makes it a thing indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent, to take a Saint of God either as the authour, or the product of the goſpel; as where it is ſaid, <hi>in Chriſt Jeſus have I begotten you through the goſpel,</hi> in which words Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians are brought in, as the proper fruit and product of the goſpel. And again, our Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>God ſhall judge you ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to my goſpel,</hi> where the Apoſtle brings in himſelf as authour of the goſpel: and again, <hi>If our goſpel be hid, it is hi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> to them that are loſt;</hi> and again, <hi>our word towards you was not yea and nay but yea:</hi> in which ſayings the Spirit of God brings in the Saints, as Authours of the word and goſpel of God. So that as it is ſaid, the children being partakers of fleſh and blood, he himſelf took part with them, that is, he became one ſtate and condition with them; even ſo it is here, that I may be partaker of the goſpel with, or in you, that is to ſay, that we together may become and appear to be that compleat ſtate, matter, and ſubſtance of the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel, even that gladſome and triumphant ſtate of ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
            <p>Whereas it is tranſlated <hi>with you,</hi> the word <hi>you</hi> is not in the text<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> to ſhew unto us the liberty and ſcope the Spirit of God gives unto our minds, in the viewing and peruſing the word of God, either to apply it more particularly, or ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend it more univerſally, giving us freedome and anthority, either to apply it to our ſelves and ſuch as we immediately converſe with, and ſo with you, or unto ſuch as have been before, or ſhall be hereafter, together with ſuch as are, and ſo with them in either reſpect, or with him; that is, with God; as God and man in Chriſt being that compleat, glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious and ſubſtantial eſtate. And it is uſual in Scripture to leave out words, or take them into the text, for ſuch honour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
<pb facs="tcp:40942:37"/>
and fruitful uſes and reſpects; as where one evangeliſt ſaith, <hi>Go ſhew to the high priest,</hi> another ſaith, <hi>go ſhew thy ſelf to the high prieſt:</hi> again, where one ſaith of the five loaves and two fiſhes, <hi>he bleſſed and brake<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> (more generally) ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſaith, <hi>he bleſſed them and brake;</hi> and where one ſaith more generally, <hi>he will gather the wheat into the garner;</hi> ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſaith, <hi>he will gather the wheat into his garner;</hi> and many ſuch like, God giving liberty to have an eye to the univerſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of a matter or cauſe, as alſo particularly, to ſuch whom it may concern, either as intereſt in, or excluded the ſame.</p>
            <p>Verſ. 24. <hi>Know ye not that they that run in a race run all;</hi> that is, you do know it is taken for granted, that all men know what it is to run in a race, for it is a thing written in the hearts of all men, ſo as they may read it in themſelves; and therefore I obtrude the knowledge thereof upon you, without all peradventure, namely, that they who run in a race run all, that is, divers are in motion therein, as ſtriving after the ſame thing; even ſo God hath ranked the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures univerſally in heaven and in earth<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that they are in a continued motion, through Gods ordination, as things pointing at, looking towards, or directing unto Chriſt; as ſo many rivers in motion towards the ſame Gole, or more particularly: All men that ever lived (do, or ſhall) upon the face of the earth, they aim at and move after that which is more excellent then themſelves, or any ſimple creature can ever be; and ſo are in continual exerciſe and motion, to gain a price which hath no leſs then God conſiderable there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, and hence it was that wicked Pharaoh<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> though he would not acknowledge the God of the Hebrews<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> yet he moved as in a race after a greater thing, or power, then was in him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf; and therefore fled to his Magicians, as ſuch as had a more eminent power to work by then himſelf had, and when they could eaſe him of the plagues, he ſeeks to Moſes, that he would me unto the God of Iſrael on his behalf; ſo that he is in motion after a prize of more worth then all his preſent attainments.</p>
            <p>So it was with the king of Babylon, he alſo was ſet in this
<pb facs="tcp:40942:37"/>
race, moving toward a greater price, when he could not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpret his own dreams he ſought to the Southſayers the Chaldeans, as having more skill then himſelf to interpret the ſame, and when they could not attain thereunto, they alſo move towards higher then themſelves, and told the king that none could expound or interpret ſuch a matter, unleſs the gods ſhould come down and converſe in fleſh, or with fleſh; ſo that all men, yea the worſt of men, are in a race where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in they ſtrive after a gole of more worth and greater excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency, then yet they have attained, and there is no true ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency (upon juſt account) to be found; but only in the Son of God Jeſus Chriſt, and as in a race, all men are ſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving to attain nnto that ſtate of Chriſt; but all cannot win the gole, it is one only that gets the prize.</p>
            <p>Note by the way the ignorance and vanity of ſuch men that go about to bring men unto the knowledge of God, by telling them ſtories out of the Scripture not analizing them with ſomething written in their own hearts, that by that li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving letter, they may ſo converſe with them, as they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not deny the truth of what is ſaid to be in themſelves, and by the verity of that, be gained to give credit unto the truth of the manner and form of the being and exerciſe of the Son of God, brought forth and declared from that which is formed and written in their hearts: for every one in this point of running ſhall be ſet in the race, indeavouring to win a prize greater then yet they have attained, from whence we are to declare who, and what it is, that only gets the gole, for they who run in a race run all: <hi>But one receiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the prize,</hi> that is to ſay, Chriſt that one Son of God, that myſtical body in the unity of ſpirit<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that one, whoſe feet are made like hinds feet, and who is called the hind of the morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, he that renews his ſtrength as the eagle, who runs and is not weary, and walks and is not faint; he only attaineth the gole, winneth the prize, and weareth the crown, and he that is not of that one undivided being, and imbodied in that one faith once delivered unto the Saints, that man ſhall never attain the gole, nor obtain the prize: for it is only one that receiveth the ſame, for it is but one wiſdome which
<pb facs="tcp:40942:38"/>
know the way, and rightly valueth the prize: it is but one ſtrength which inableth to outſtrip and over<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>go all the reſt, and it is but one breath or wind of the ſpirit, that can poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly hold out from the firſt unto the laſt, that is, from the firſt goings forth of the Son of God in the early morning, or glory of his firſt appearance, unto that late evening, or ſetting of the Sun of all humane excellencies, as the laſt or baſeſt things, with reſpect unto the glory and dignity of the Son of God, it is only one therefore that receiveth the prize, from which he inforceth this exhortation, viz.</p>
            <p>

            <p>For I am not as one beating or fighting with the aire, as with a thing of no ſubſtance, I doing no real exploit, nor it receiving any wound or foil from me, but cloſeth up and healeth it ſelf again as faſt as it receiveth the ſtrokes; but contrarily I beat down and bring to nought, that which hath in it the reality of ſin and death, which is the wiſdome or law of the fleſh.</p>
            <p>As certainly as I guard and defend that which hath in it the reality of eternal life and peace, namely, tbat wiſdome or law of the Spirit of life which is in Chriſt Jeſus my Lord, exerciſing it ſelf in the one, and the other in my ſoul, and that no otherwiſe, but as it ſhall be my life and peace, ſpirit and power, proweſs and victorious imployment and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt forever, for the offices, exerciſes, and virtues of Chriſt, are all of like honour, worth, and duration.</p>
            <p>Verſ. 27. <hi>But I beat down my body,</hi> that is, the body of ſin and death, and it is my body as in the original and mate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rials of it, conſiſting of God and man<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as truly as Eſau and Jacob came both out of loyns of Iſack and Rebekkah, ſo doth the body of ſin ariſe of God and man, being made one in that way of the body of death, and alſo that myſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call body of life in Chriſt; in the one the properties and heavenly diſpoſition of the Son of God are crucified, to the ſin and Satan in the Son of perdition, and in the other the properties and earthly diſpoſition of man, a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

of all fleſh, as the goſpel is my goſpel, as in the ſpirit of God I come down from heaven, and ſo am one with the Son of God, being of the ſame ſpirit with him, who is both the authour and product thereof.</p>
            <p>Again it is my body, as I die thereunto dayly (as the ſame Apoſtle ſpeaks) and alſo it dies nnto me; ſo, as it never hath any power over dominion or me, or I any community or fellowſhip with it, even as the body of Chriſt is mine, as I riſe and live in newneſs of life unto it, and it, unto me, wherein conſiſts my proper and only converſe and fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſh p.</p>
            <p>Again it is my body, as I acknowledge the miſery and wretchedneſs of all ſleſh deſtitute of the wiſdome and Spirit of God, and ſo it is gone over all, in regard of the apti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude and diſpoſition of all men naturally inclining thereun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to, and ſo I can ſay in that reſpect, O wretched man that I am, who ſhall deliver me from this body of death.</p>
            <p>Even as I can give God thanks as in that body of Chriſt, acknowledging by the ſpirit thereof my deliverance, happy condition<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and ſalvation, being inabled by the ſame ſpirit to bring that body of death into ſubjection, in all things exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſing the rule and authority of the Son of God over it, ſo as it can never prevail againſt me; but though the enemy may come againſt me as a flood, yet the Spirit of the Lord lifts up a ſtanderd againſt him to chaſe him away: ſo that in my mind, that is, in the formings, faſhionings, and framings of all things in my ſpirit, I ſerve the law of God, but in my fleſh, that is, as my natural diſpoſition is found in the men of the world out of Chriſt, there it is under ſin and death, being a ſervant thereunto forever. Now the ground and rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon why I thus beat down my body, and bring it in ſubiecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and not the body of another, is this, viz.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Leſt whilſt I preach to others, I my ſelf ſhould become a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probate,</hi> in theſe words our Apoſtle doth elegantly, as in a fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure, (as he ſpeaks formerly in this epiſtle in a like caſe) trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferring the ſtate and condition of all falſe teachers of the word of God unto himſelf, that thereby he may with mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty ſet them forth and make them appear in truth to be that which indeed they are.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:40942:41"/>
               <hi>Leſt while I preach to others,</hi> or as the word is, <hi>leſt while I preach in others:</hi> the word <hi>leſt,</hi> is not brought in here as a doubt or ſuppoſition; but as a thing of certainty, as if he ſhould ſay, he who preacheth in another, he is a reprobate, or he is reproved, rejected, or is become a caſtaway, as diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>allowed of God. So that the Apoſtles argument ſtands thus, he that preacheth in another, that which he preacheth not in himſelf, as being matter of the goſpel: that miniſter and miniſtry is as reprobate ſilver, it is diſallowed of God, and never paſſeth for currant doctrine in his kingdome; So that he which forms ſin in ſuch ſort, as that he inveighs againſt it, and indeavours to beat it down in another and not in himſelf, as being free from a ſin of that nature, as in or of himſelf, that is a reprobate miniſtry, he beats the aire and doth not beat down that body which is his: that miniſtry therefore that forms ſin ſo, as to belong to one ſtate of men and not unto another, to be a ſin in one age of the world, but not in another; or to belong to one ſix or age of man, and not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to another: that man doth not in all things beat down his own body, that is a wicked and diſallowed miniſtry, rejected and reprobated by God, and doth in his heart conclude, that the righteouſneſs of Chriſt, is one thing to one Saint, and another thing in another Saint, that it is of one virtue in one age of the world, and of another virtue more or leſs, or ſome alteration in another age, this is reprobate doctrine, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected and reproved by God.</p>
            <p>For our Apoſtle ſaith, I beat down <hi>my body,</hi> not the body of another; So that they who ſeem to beat down ſin in an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other, and know not how to make it their own, as it being naturally in that body whereof they by nature are: ſuch are in this miniſtry of reprobation, therefore all ſuch as go about to cry down a ſin which was committed in a body deſtitute of humane nature, that is the ſin of angels before man was, or at the leaſt before man ſinned; theſe beat down ſin in an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other, not in their own body, a ſin (ſay they) which man was never guilty of, nor ſubject unto (for ſay they) man ſinned by means of a tempter, but the evil angels, the devils they ſinned without a tempter, theſe men preach in another,
<pb facs="tcp:40942:42"/>
not in themſelves, and theſe our Apoſtle, by transferring the thing to himſelf, concludes by the Spirit of God, that it is a reprobate and rejected miniſtry, diſallowed of God in all good men throughout all ages.</p>
            <p>They therefore that preach a ſin without that body where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of man by nature is, which are all thoſe which preach the fall of angels not to be the proper fall of man, and the ſin of the devil in its firſt act, not to be the proper ſin of man, as well as of Satan, all theſe are reprobate miniſters, and this their miniſtry is reproved, rejected, and diſallowed of God.</p>
            <p>Again, they who preach a righteouſneſs, a wiſdome, a ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctification, or redemption that is in another, but not in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves; or that which is not in all the Saints of God, as real<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly as they in it, or as really in all as in any one, theſe preach in another, but not in themſelves, they build up (or ſeem to do) another, not their own, theſe are reprobate miniſters ſuch as are rejected and diſallowed of God.</p>
            <p>And wherewithall ſhall theſe men come before the Lord, and bow themſelves before the high God, ſhall they come before him with burnt-offerings, with calves of a year old, will the Lord be pleaſed with thouſands of rams, or with ten thouſands of rivers of oyl, ſhall they give their firſt-born for their tranſgreſſion, or the fruit of their body, for the ſin of their ſoul.</p>
            <p>But thou, O man of God, who art known of him: he ſhall ſhew unto thee what is good; yea, what that good thing is which is only acceptable unto him, and what doth he require of thee; but to do juſtly, and to love mercy, and to abaſe thy ſelf in point of all humane excellencies, that ſo thou may walk in the power, and glory of thy God, Amen.</p>

            <p>The word <hi>ſcribe</hi> ſignifies an expounder of the law; and ſo the Evangeliſt Luke hath it, ſaying, <hi>wo be to you expound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of the law,</hi> that is, ye reporters of, or bringers in the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riginal and firſt foundation of the law, and records of the kingdome.</p>
            <p>The word <hi>phariſe</hi> ſignifies one who curiouſly divides, makes diſtinctions in the interpretation, or propheſie, fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telling what will inſue and come to paſs upon the principles and foundations premiſed, which are never ſeparated, and
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:40942:45"/>
therefore Luke concludes them in one, <hi>Luke</hi> 11. 52. ſaying, <hi>Wo be to you lawyers, or wo be to you interpreters of the law.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The word hypocrite or diſſembler, is therefore added to declare that they give a falſe expoſition and interpretation of the law of God, both in the ground and original of things, as alſo in all the ſucceſs and proſecutions thereof, otherwiſe the words, ſcribes and phariſes might be taken in a good ſenſe.</p>
            <p n="1">1. The word hypocrite properly ſignifies a ſtage-player, which ſort of men we know are counterfeits in divers re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects; firſt they counterfeit the perſons of men, repreſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing godly or noble men, when they are of no ſuch diſpoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, nor degree; ſo do falſe interpreters repreſent the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of Chriſt, yet cannot but confeſs he is as far remote as heaven is from earth.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The ſtage-players counterfeit the records and hiſtories of a kingdome, as though they were now in their wiſe and grave agitation and ſolemnization, when as they cannot but confeſs there is nothing but a bare reſemblance of them; and ſo do falſe interpreters, they treat of the records and hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of the Scripture, when as they confeſs they were in act long ago, and are not now in preſent and real exiſtance.</p>
            <p n="3">3. The ſtage-players counterfeit time, pretending the ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of Gods providence for the bringing forth of ſuch ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations; yet cannot but confeſs the time of them is paſt, and at preſent is only aſſemblance of it: So do falſe interpreters, they pretend the primative of the church, and yet know no more how to make this time the firſt time, then they know how to make a Chriſtian in theſe dayes to be the firſt begot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten of God, therefore meer counterfeiters of time.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Stage players counterfeit places, if he draw but a cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain they act as in the Kings pallace, when it may be but in a ſtew or brothel houſe: So do falſe interpreters, draw but out wine and wafer, or water, and a perſon without vale or co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering, and the act as in the pallace of the king of Saints; and in the mean time confeſs that his dwelling is in heaven<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> where themſelves never as yet came: and thus falſe interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters are the ſtage players of the world, who diſſemble the
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:40942:45"/>
being of perſons, hiſtories, times, and places, and cannot but confeſs the reality of them is out of being in point of preſent appearance.</p>
            <p>Whereas the truth of interpretation doth not only com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend them all, extending it ſelf unto them; but alſo ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thereth them up into preſent exerciſe, and that in the reality of their proper being.</p>
            <p>For he that can look back upon the word and work of God, he knows how to convey himſelf thither (or elſe it is a dead letter unto him) he alſo knows how to bring up &amp; con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vey that word and work to take place and give it ſelf a real and preſent being in himſelf, otherwiſe it is not become a quickening ſpirit unto him, and the like skill that the ſpirit of the Scriptures hath to convey it ſelf back to the original and foundation of things, it hath alſo to convey it ſelf for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward to the accompliſhing and finiſhing of them, not only in after times, but alſo in the time preſent, otherwiſe it is as the word of man ſubject to times and ſeaſons, and not as the word of God that is ever the ſame as himſelf is.</p>
            <p>Therefore it is that Chriſt ſaith before Abraham was <hi>I am,</hi> and the prophet Hoſea, ſpeaking of Jacob, converſing with God, ſaith, <hi>he met him in Bethel, and there he ſpake with us,</hi> and the Lord hath ſet up this name as his memorial in Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham Iſaac and Jacob, as being in them conveyed unto Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes and all the Saints of God, namely, <hi>I am that I am,</hi> hath ſent thee: for if the ſender had not been in him that was ſent, thoſe great works in Egypt had never been effected for the memorizing of the name of God forever.</p>
            <p>Wo therefore unto falſe and counterfeit interpreters of the law of God, which wo doth not only concern ſuch as know themſelves to deal deceitfully with the Scriptures for advantage, but alſo ſuch as upon falſe principles, are never ſo much perſwaded that they ſpeak truth, whether they deliver it unto others, or receive and take it in as upon their own ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count it skils not, the matter is the ſame, and hath the ſame acceptance and reward, intailed.</p>
            <p>The word <hi>wo,</hi> is a voice of curſing, as an edict or pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clamation given out by Chriſt as ruler of all things, which
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:40942:46"/>
none can gain ſay, or contradict<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> containing the whole ſum in every part and particular of that curſed eſtate and condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of ſin and unrighteouſneſs, as brought in and continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed among the ſons of men, by falſe and hypocritical inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretation of the word of God, as being no other but the ſpirit of the ſerpent from the beginning, who is ſaid to be <hi>the dragon that old ſerpent which is the devil and Satan,</hi> Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vel 20. 2.</p>
            <p>And this woful and ſinful eſtate and condition as the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per portion and patrimony of all falſe interpreters being the only ſpirit, whereby they live in foſtring and maintaining the deeds of the fleſh, is appoſed unto that bleſſed condition of the Son of God, the fountain and original of all happineſs, whoſe ſpirit is the true intent, and proper ſcope of the word of God, in which alone his life is preſerved and maintained forever, and therefore <hi>he is called the word of God,</hi> and ſaith of his proper language, <hi>the words that I ſpeak are ſpirit and life;</hi> therefore without true interpretation of the Scriptures, no conſervation but a crucification of the Son of God.</p>
            <p>Therefore it is that Chriſt ſo often ingeminates and reite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rates this word <hi>wo,</hi> as the curſe conſiſting in falſe interpreta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion being that, and alſo thoſe which put him to death, the perſons and the ſpears being one, therefore the Prophet cries out unto God, <hi>Rebuke the company of ſp<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>2. as ſuch as make hollow the word of God, emptying it of the proper ſpirit thereof, which thereby becomes as a ſpunge to draw in ſharp, bitter, and tart things to preſent unto Chriſt, that is, cruel and ſavage perſecutions even unto death: therefore the prophet calls them <hi>the mighty bulls and calves of the people,</hi> that is, the high prieſts, ſcribes, phariſes, and elders, who falſly expound and apply the word of God, to the putting of it to death, of whom the prophet largely comments in that two and twentieth Pſalme.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="5" facs="tcp:40942:46"/>
Now to deſcribe a falſe expoſitour of the word of God, as a general Maxim, to hold true undeni bly and univerſally in the diſcovery of them in all times, places, and perſons, is this,</p>
            <p>They deny the word of God its proper and natural riſe, and accordingly carry it to an improper and unnatural cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.</p>
            <p>Firſt they deny the word of God its proper and natural riſe, that is, they conclude that all things whereinſoever God hath expreſſed himſelf do not ariſe, nor have their original in the word of God, as conſidered and conſiſting in the uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of God and man, no nor that any thing in the firſt act of creating the world, could poſſibly ariſe out of ſuch a foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain; but ſay they, that device of God and man being one, was only brought in after man had ſinned, but in the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning all things were good, yea man himſelf in a goodneſs beſides, ſhort of, and out of Chriſt.</p>
            <p>Whereas the truth is there was never reality of goodneſs to be found as coming within the account of God, but only in that work of God, and man being made one in Chriſt, therefore it is that when the man ſaid unto Chriſt <hi>(good ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster)</hi> taking him for a meer man, Chriſt asks him, why cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſt thou me good, there is none good but God, not deny<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing himſelf to be good, but that goodneſs doth not conſiſt in the excellencies of the creature, but in the excellencies of the Spirit of God that made all things, and what work ſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver holds nor proportion with the mind of the maker, hath not the reallity of goodneſs in it; and that was never found but only in that device and workmanſhip of Chriſt, who is the ingraven form of Gods ſubſiſtauce, and that which gives being to all things, without whom they are not, never were, nor ſhall be.</p>
            <p>For the wiſdome of God is the original and fountain of all things, as maker and former of them all; but the wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of God doth properly conſiſt in that device of the creature and creatour, being made one in Chriſt, without which Gods wiſdome could never appear: for he cannot be known but by his own light, <hi>Pſalme</hi> 36 9. ther efore the uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:40942:47"/>
of God and man in that faith of Chriſt, is the proper o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riginal, fountain, and cauſe of all things, and hath all things in it, wherein the reallity of goodneſs doth conſiſt, and all other things are but as the hand upon the dyal, which points at time which it ſelf is not, ſo do all other things in heaven and earth point at an eternal ſtate and condition, which not any, nor all of themſelves either are or ever ſhall be.</p>
            <p>So that he that brings out an original goodneſs or righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs in angel or man, and not out of this fountain of God and man being one in Chriſt, he is a falſe interpreter of the word of God, and the doctrine of ſuch is that which is and ever was, the proper inlet of ſin and wrath upon the ſons of Adam; for being they raiſe righteouſneſs and good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs from a falſe fountain, they bring in the devils to be the ſtate of Chriſt, as all Idolaters have ever don from the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, and ſuch is the falſhood of the fountain out of which their doctrine ſprings; and therefore it is that the conſulta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the ſerpent, who is ſaid to be wiſer then any beaſt which the Lord God made, proves the very devil and Satan, <hi>Revel.</hi> 20 2. himſelf.</p>
            <p>Secondly, falſe interpreters terminate the word of God in a falſe and counterfeit center, in that they carry the intent and ſcope thereof to other things beſides Chriſt, that is God and man in unity, ſuch are they who center the word of God in good angels, which they confeſs are not in this unity, alſo in man in his firſt creation, which they exclude from this uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> of ſuch miſtake is the centring of the word of God (as being the intent thereof) in offices and ordinances called di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine and civil, which have not the nature, and alſo the du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of this unity in them; for Chriſt is the firſt and the laſt, the beginning and the end, the proper riſe and termina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of all things, therefore he is ſaid to be the Lord our Lawgiver, and alſo the end of the law, <hi>Revel.</hi> 22. 13, <hi>Iſaiah</hi> 33. 22. <hi>Roman.</hi> 10. 4.</p>
            <p>Therefore it is no law of God in what relation ſoever con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered that terminates, or ends in any thing ſhort of, or beſides Chriſt; yet do we not deny the lawful uſe of any humane ordinances, no more then we deny the ordinance of
<pb facs="tcp:40942:47"/>
the Sun and of the moon: So they be uſed as becomes the nature of them in their time and ſeaſon, which are all found to be in the judgement of God no better then empty husks, ſuch as the prodigal fed upon, being deſtitute of this unity which is in Chriſt, <hi>Luke<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> 15. 16, 17. ſo that further then they direct us unto Chriſt, they are no bread becoming our fathers houſe, and ſo will appear when ever we come to our ſelves, by getting out of that way of prodigallity, but if we terminate the law of God in them, they all become Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trous, which have proved the ſnares and Idols of the world unto this day, whilſt counterfeit and hypocritical interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters preſent wood and ſtone and fooliſh pictures unto us, that we may bend oll our zeal only againſt ſuch traſh, that in the mean time Satan and his miniſters may raign as angels of light, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11. 13, 14, 15.</p>
            <p>And thus much briefly for preſent in the deſcribing of a falſe interpreter of the word of God.</p>
            <p>Now that we may the better underſtand their juſt deſert of ſo many woes pronounced againſt them in this chapter, let us take a ſhort ſum and view of the particular ground and cauſe of the pronunciation of every wo, as they lie in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, before we come to this which we have read,

            <p>Secondly, a widow is deſolate and void of a protectour, for the man is the defence of the woman in all ſuits that come againſt her, or challenge that can be made of her, and therefore Abimelech ſaith unto Sarah concerning Abraham her husband, <hi>Behold he is unto thee a couering of the eyes,</hi> Gen. 20. 16. that is a defence unto thee whereever thou comeſt, therefore Sarah is ſaid <hi>to obey him and calls him lord,</hi> 1 Pet. 3. 6.</p>

            <p>Fifthly, a widow is deſtitute of means to multiply and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe the family, therefore as ſhe is a wife ſhe is ſaid <hi>to be as a fruitful vine upon the ſides o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

            <p>So they make their phillactaries broad and their fringes long, alluding to the Levitical law, to declare them to be of that litteral and carnal prieſthood, which puts Chriſt to death which ever ſeeks after a carnal and temporary lordſhip and dominion, <hi>Matth.</hi> 4. 8. 9. therefore Matthew uſeth the word phillactaries, which ſignifies keepers, as though that grave and long-robed elderſhip were the only keepers of mens ſouls, bodies, names, and eſtates.</p>
            <p>The word tranſlated fringes, in Hebrew <hi>Gedilim,</hi> which ſometimes is tranſlated wreathes, 1 <hi>King.</hi> 7. 17. <hi>Exodus</hi> 28. 24. and ſometimes ropes or cords, <hi>Iudges</hi> 16. 11, 12. twiſted together by the Levitical prieſthood, or made of the mate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rials, and by the skill of the ſpirit of the Philliſtians, which hath no power at all over our ſpiritual Sampſon, but are bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken in ſunder as a thred, in Hebrew alſo a fringe is called <hi>Tſitſith,</hi> or <hi>Zizith, Numb.</hi> 15. 38. which is ſometimes tranſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted <hi>a lock of hair of the head,</hi> Ezekiel 8. 3. to ſhow a multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude united together in one head.</p>
            <p>And the Greek word uſed by the holy Ghoſt in Matthew, <hi>Craſpeda,</hi> doth properly ſignifie twiſted taſſels of thred, and the Hebrew word uſed for fringe is Engliſhed a thred, <hi>Iudg.</hi> 16. 9.</p>

            <p>The point then amounts to this in falſe interpreters of the law of God, in making their phillactaries broad and their fringes long, on the four skirts of their garments, that they love to be thought to be the keepers of people, and to be

            <p>And men may eat and drink, and whatſoever they do to the praiſe and glory of God, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10. 31.</p>
            <p>But when men go on in the exerciſes and executions of humane and temporary things, as being offices and ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances as the law of God intends, and in which it termi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nates it ſelf, as the proper ſcope or any part of the meaning, that is no leſs then to diſthrone the Son of God, and ſet up Pharaoh, juſtifie Herod, and take parts with thoſe heathen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh and barbarous princes that ever did, do, or ſhall lift up themſelves againſt Chriſt; for they have all that principle written in their hearts, to terminate the mind and will of God (in point of approving or abhorring) in temporary and tranſient things.</p>
            <p>We conclude then that the matters of the kingdome of God are more eminent, and ſo of higher concernment, then to ſtand either in the extention or extenuation of any thing, which hath its proper being and only exerciſe within the bounds and confines of this mortal life, therefore it is that Chriſt ſaith my kingdome is not of this world, <hi>John</hi> 18. 36. no not in any vocal expreſſion or bodily exerciſe, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4. 8. but in the execution and intention of that eternall ſpirit, whereby the Son of God offereth up himſelf unto God, <hi>Heb.</hi> 9. 14. for if the kingdome of God ſhould conſiſt in any
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:40942:54"/>
thing bounded by this mortal life, then would it ſuffer loſs in every Saint, in the laying down of the body in the duſt, by ceſſation unto all theſe things, which every man holds rather to be the perfecting of it.</p>
            <p>But it ſtands in the meek and ſubmiſſive reception of the word of eternity and power, as an ingrafted word <hi>James</hi> 1<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 21. that is, accord ng to the Metaphor, the wiſdome and will of God in his choſen hath from the beginning, ſo cut the proper branch and topped the heighth of the ſpirit of man, which it by nature otherwiſe brings forth; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by ſubmitted it to the reception of an eternal and higher wiſdome, which ingrafts it ſelf as a ſcience into the ſtock of mans ſpirit (being a creature made in time) through this cutting of it off from its natural growth, as from that ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfluous foreskin of the fleſh, which is the proper cauſe of the ſeed of immortallity its not taking effect, which muſt be laid aſide or caſt off, as that which is the only filthineſs and enmity againſt God, 1 <hi>James</hi> 1. 21.</p>
            <p>This eternal wiſdome therefore thus ingrafting it ſelf into the ſtock of mans ſpirit, doth by virtue of that nature<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> life, and ſpirit proper to it ſelf, transform and change whatſoever is in motion, or ſprings up in the ſtock into its own nature and kind, namely, into things not of time but of eternity, ſo that whatſoever ſprings up, or fruit yielded, by that whole tree conſiſting of ſtock and ſcience, are the proper fruits of the Spirit of God, and not of the nature of the ſpirit of man, though that whole tree of righteouſneſs hath the vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, glory, and benefit, and is the proper cauſe of the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bounding and bring forth of them all.</p>
            <p>Chriſt therefore, as he is the fountain and proper produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cer of all ſpiritual and eternal fruit, ſo is the fruit thus brought forth, the proper food and refreſhment of the Son of God, on which he feeds as his only delight and proper preſervati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of eternal life, <hi>Cant.</hi> 4, 13, 14, 15, 16. <hi>Cant.</hi> 5. 1. <hi>Iohn</hi> 4<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 32. <hi>Iohn</hi> 6. 54.</p>
            <p>Wherefore the diſtributions and receptions of the things of God mutually in Chriſt, is the only conſervation of that one ſtate (being made of twain) unto eternity, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 2. 14, 15.</p>

Whence we may obſerve wherein that broad difference appears even in this life, that is betwixt the holy ones of God, and the wicked of the world, though they may uſe the like expreſſions, and perform like bodily actions, which is not ſo viſible but by the intentions and extention of ſpirit, that is, the Saints of God make it their only errant in their paſſage through this life, to propagate and promote the things of eternity peculiar to that ſtate of the Son of God, with the villification of, and ſitting looſe from all things of time, as they being no part of their deſigne in their appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in this mortal and tranſitory life, and ſo demean them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in all things of time, if they abound, they think not themſelves the better, nor place any of their delight, cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage, or confidence in them, <hi>Pſalm.</hi> 62. 10.</p>
            <p>If they be deminiſhed they judge not themſelves the worſe, becauſe they reckon not their eſtates according to the value of any or all of them, and therefore are not under the vexation of an incumbred ſpirit in the abſence of them, <hi>Iob</hi> 1. 21. by which they ſhew themſelves plainly unto all men that they belong to another citie, and countrey, in which God is not aſhamed, but counts it his glory and honour to be called their God, and proper and peculiar intereſt, in whatever he is, being they are but ſojourners, pilgrims, and ſtrangers upon the earth <hi>Heb.</hi> 11. 9. 14, 15<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 16.</p>

            <p>Therefore it is, that they call their ſons, their houſes, and lands, by their own name, <hi>Pſalme</hi> 49. 11, 12, 13. there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Pſalmiſt in uttering of his parable, wherein he ſhows mans mortal condition by nature, and his baſeneſs and brutiſhneſs in ſetting his heart upon temporary things, he calls them inhabitants of time, or dwellers upon tranſitory things, ſaying, here this all people<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> give eare all ye inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants <hi>of time;</hi> for ſo the word tranſlated world doth proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſignifie in the Hebrew phraſe, <hi>Pſalme</hi> 49. 1.</p>
            <p>As a man therefore in his houſe and dwelling place, all his indeavours are to maintain, reform, repair, promote, and honour the ſame: yea, and he is never at his proper home but when he is there, nor in content nor at reſt; ſo are the wicked in point of the things of time, being from home, out of imployment, ſeeing nothing worth promotion there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in nor yielding ſatisfaction and reſt, when the proper home and imployments about the Son of God appear, which are only eternal and fade not, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 4. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 5. 4. and the only imployment and dwelling place of all the Saints which are not only Symptoms, but evident acts of ſeparation be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the juſt and unjuſt, which he that runs may read where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever they both appear.</p>
            <p>And for concluſion of this point note this, that as the wiſdome of God is as a graft in the ſpirit of the creature ſo as to eternize it in himſelf, even ſo alſo the wiſdome of the
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:40942:56"/>
creature, ingrafts it ſelf in the ſpirit of the Creatour, to the mortalizing and temporizing it in himſelf; for the wiſdome of man beholding the viſible works of God which were all made before him; cannot but conclude of an almighty pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er and wiſdome which gave them their being<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> virtues, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation; and ſeeing none below him, fit to communicate his wiſdome with, ſeeks up unto God as the ſerpent (which is the ſame thing) did at the firſt; and ſo in that way of the fall ſeeking for God in the light and ability of principles proper to a creature, he doth ingraft his wiſdome in the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of the Creatour; as a ſciene into the ſtock which is of another nature, by cutting of that <hi>Branch which ſprings out of a dry ground, Iſaia</hi> 53. 2. (and not out of any moiſture of mans wiſdome) ſubmitting the ſtock to humane wiſdom and conjectures coming within the capacity and proper ſphere of a creature through which he doth as abſolutely temporize and mortallize the eternal Spirit or word of God, as the wiſdome of God in Chriſt doth eternize the ſpirit of the creature, which by its own nature and property is mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentany and mortal.</p>
            <p>So that in this inocculation of the wiſdome or word of the creature, all the motions and operations ſpringing up in the Creatour (as being the ſtock which in it ſelf is eternal) are all tranſlated and changed into temporallity and mortality, and ſo the power of God works effectually in the way of death, as the wiſdome of God implanted in the weakneſs of man, the creature comes to work effectually in that way of eternal life, and that whole ſtate or tree, is but one eternal Son and Saviour.</p>
            <p>And in that implanting of the wiſdome of man in the power of God; that whole ſtate or tree is a ſtate of mortal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity and deſtruction, and is but one ſon of perdition, and law of ſin and death, becauſe all that ſpring up, and what fruit it yields is of the nature of the ſcience, and doth not ſavour of the ſtock at all, but is become mortal and diabolical, even as a man in that way of Chriſt is become eternal and the real ſon of the immortal God.</p>
            <p>So long therefore as an eternal wiſdome abides to draw
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:40942:56"/>
forth the ſtock, in whatſoever it yields according to the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of the ſcience, ſo long ſhall the fruits of righteouſneſs and delight appear upon the Saints in a bleſſed eſtate and condition.</p>
            <p>And ſo long as the power and plenty of an eternal ſtock yields any motion or matter of growth, ſo long ſhall that graft or ſcience of the wiſdome of the fleſh, mortalize it and change it into corruption in it ſelf, (then the which grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter indignity cannot be done unto a pure and immortal word or ſpirit) ſo long ſhall that unhappy, guilty, and accurſed condition of the wicked abide and remain, ſo that both e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtates have their pereminency ariſing from the eternity of the holy word of God, though the one be a ſtate of the eternal life, and the other a ſtate of eternal death; and the ſtock of each is no proper cauſe of the fruit which the whole tree yields and forever brings forth.</p>

            <p>For a man to conclude that any Saint of God fails or falls ſhort of the grace of God, in any particular wherein ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther hath intereſt, is that root of bitterneſs, or gall of worm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wood, which ſprings up to the trouble of all the world, for it is that which ſprings up as the Greek tranſlates, <hi>en cholee,</hi> with gall, <hi>Dent.</hi> 29. 18. and <hi>enochlee,</hi> with trouble, <hi>Heb.</hi> 12. 15. having both the bitterneſs of death in it, being the bond iniquity, <hi>Acts</hi> 8. 23. and the trouble and vexation of dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inheriting in the loſs of the firſt birthright: therefore the Apoſtle brings in the fornication and profaneneſs of Eſau thereupon, as under the guilt of ſin, <hi>Heb.</hi> 12. 16. as alſo the trouble of his being disinherited, as ſeeking a bleſſing too late with tears; for there is no place of repentance found in the father, <hi>Heb.</hi> 12. 17. or way to change his mind forever; the Apoſtle concludes this to be the defilement of many, that is to ſay of all the world, for ſo the word many is ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, <hi>Rom</hi> 5. 18.</p>

            <p>For however we know that their is a ſpiritual death, reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection, and aſcention, and ſitting on the right hand of God, and that there is a ſpiritual kingdome, prieſthood, elderſhip, Church, and people of God; yet we know alſo that to ſay theſe are become ſuch only by having the Spirit of Chriſt, that is to ſay as he is God, and not as being Chriſt complete his body or any office thereof, is to deny the Spirit of Chriſt to be that which it is, which is a denyal of Chriſt himſelf, and ſo a moſt falſe interpretation of Scripture; for the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of Chriſt never wrought nor appeared in way of ſalvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, but in that way of fleſh in that ſenſe which it is ſaid the word was made fleſh, or is made fleſh and tabernacles in us, as the words are, and we ſaw his glory as the glory, or as the word is <hi>verily</hi> the glory of the only begotten of the father full of grace and truth, <hi>Iohn</hi> 1. 14.</p>
            <p>So that he maintains a Spirit of Chriſt (early or late) with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the complete matter whereof Chriſt conſiſts, that man is ignorant of Chriſt, and interprets the word in the denyal of him, being that ſpirit denies that Jeſus Chriſt is come in the fleſh, which is not of God but is that ſpirit of antichriſt, 1 <hi>Iohn</hi> 4. 2, 3. for to confeſs Chriſt Jeſus as born of the Virgin Mary only in the dayes of Herod, is not confeſſion which the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle intends for <hi>it,</hi> that his coming in the fleſh in the confeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on thereof were to ſpeak by the Spirit of God, I think then all that ever ſpoke the Latine tongue would prove ſpeakers by the Spirit of God; and then ſuch as they ſtile Papiſts

            <p>Not but that the Saints of God may be furniſhed with a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>billity to know any art or ſcience as well as any other man, and have the practice of it, only with this two fold caveat, they know all humane and temporary things through the valing of them, and the vaniſhing of them; if they know them ſo as Chriſt is propagated u<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>to them by the knowing of them, as <hi>he is the true end of all things,</hi> Rom. 10. 4. Rom. 11. 36. So to know them is to vale them in point of all glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry or excellency appearing in them, (heing ſo truly known) even as Tamar was valed when Judah knew her in the propa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation of Phares, <hi>Gen.</hi> 38. 13. 13, 14, 15, 16, 19, 20, 21. of whom Chriſt came, <hi>Matth.</hi> 1. 8. ſo that in knowing her, he knew her not, the Saints look upon the glory of the world, as an inticing harlot, nſing it as though they uſed it not, and buy as though they poſſeſſed not, for the faſhion of it paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth away, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7. 31.

Therefore the Apoſtle ſpeaking of that glory which ſeems to be in the admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration of the law, which he calls the miniſtry of condemna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, ſaith it hath no glory when the miniſtration of the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit appears, which he calls the exceeding or excellent glory, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3 9, 10.</p>
            <p>To conclude this point, thoſe who ſee ſuch excellencies to appear in the multitude as to uſe all their pollicy and induſtry to bring all into a uniformity, they never ſaw the excellent glory; but they are ſuch men of renown as were in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning the Giants of the world, who to bring forth a mighty and monſtrouſe generation, bring into contract and covenant the poſterity of Cain and Seth, in the point and matter of increaſe, abroad have been the ruine of the world ever ſince it exiſted, <hi>Gen.</hi> 6. chap. the only compoſers of ſea and land to the production of the deluge of Gods diſplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure upon the ſons of men.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Therefore the third point is the iſſue, <hi>when you have made him he is two fold more the child of hell then you your ſelves,</hi> that is, when falſe interpretation of the law hath be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten a ſpirit of pride and cruelty, to execute according to thoſe lying and diſſembling dictates, which is the bringing forth of a carnal kingdome erected by ſuch a prieſthood, which are never ſeparated no more then the kingdome and prieſthood of Chriſt are ſeparated in Melchiſedech, <hi>Gen.</hi> 14. 18. <hi>Heb.</hi> 7. 1. then the child of hell is completed as being two fold wreathed and twiſted together, which the prieſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood alone could not be, which is univerſally a ſpirit of fear and terrour, further then it is backed with its truſt in man, and in the power of the arm of fleſh, <hi>Jerem.</hi> 17. 5. and as Satan is a lyer from the beginning and the father, thereof, <hi>Iohn</hi> 8. 44. even ſo this falſe interpretation, is a child tyranni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call and Satanicall, and alſo the father of it: So that the ſons of men have ever been deceived and undone thereby, and is the greateſt judgement that ever came upon mankind, <hi>Ierem.</hi> 5. 29, 30, 31. <hi>Ieeem.</hi> 6. 13, 13, 14, 15. 2 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 2. 9, 10<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 11, 12. for it is the proper fountain of all plague that comes upon man in all ages of the world, and ever ſhall be;

for being the only inlet of ſin, it muſt needs be the inlet of all miſchief, <hi>Gen.</hi> 3. 4, 5. of ſuch nature, product and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence is the falſe and deceitful interpretation of the word of God.</p>
            <p n="4">4. The cauſe of the fourth wo, is expreſſed in the 16. verſe of this chapter, and ſo on to the 23. verſe, concluding theſe falſe interpreters to be blind guides, the word tranſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted <hi>blind,</hi> ſignifies not only to be blind, but alſo to make blind; they are blind becauſe they ſay they ſee, <hi>Iohn</hi> 9. 40, 41. that is, becauſe they conclude the light of humane rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon is the light of God, therefore their ſin of blindneſs doth remain upon them, by which light and argumentation they hinder and extinguiſh the wiſdome and argumentation of God in themſelves and others, and ſo do make blind, as really as they are blindneſſe, <hi>and if the light that is in them be darkneſs, how great is that darkneſs,</hi> Matth. 6. 23. <hi>Jf ſalt have loſt its ſavour wherewith ſhall it be cured or ſalted,</hi> Matth. 5. 13. It is henceforth good for nothing, for all remedy of recovery of taſte is gone, ſo if light be become darkneſs what ſhall inlighten it; for all means of recovery is gone, if light be made darkneſs: So that if the light of life be made darkneſs in man by tranſlating it into humane wiſdome, there is left no means to recover it, for that which ſhould cure, is become the very mallady it ſelf.</p>
            <p>Therefore Chriſt tells them what they ſay, <hi>ye ſay,</hi> ſaith he, that is, you teach and affirm ſuch things as blindneſs and ignorance brings forth, therefore calls them blind guides or dark leaders, that is leaders in darkneſs, and confuſion where nothing takes aright form; but leaders and followers fall in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the pit together, <hi>Matth.</hi> 15, 14. <hi>Luke</hi> 6. 39. before they are aware thereof, <hi>Matth.</hi> 24. 43.</p>
            <p>The doctrine they teach is this, <hi>that wh ſoever ſhall ſwear by the temple it is nothing, but whoſoever ſhall ſwear by the gold of the temple he <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                  </gap> a debter,</hi> Matth 23<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 16<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that is, he that is ſworn or ingaged unto the temple or pallace, which is the dwelling place of the Lord, his Sanctuary and place of wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, <hi>Pſalme</hi> 29. 9. That man, ſay they, is not bound alwayes to attend there: for in ſome caſes there was tolleration to ſend
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:40942:61"/>
an offering to the temple, and he that prayed and looked but towards the temple though remote in baniſhment it was ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 6. 38, 39.</p>
            <p>Again, the places of worſhip hath been divers, as in A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brahams family, in Noahs family, in the Tabernacle among the tribes, in the temple, in Solomons dayes, in Chriſts fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and in particular congregations in the dayes of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles; and yet a new Temple and new Jeruſalem, with thoſe glorious foundations and gates to be looked for, <hi>Revel.</hi> 21. 10, 23. and a Church member, whatever he be, in theſe dayes may be diſmiſſed from one Church or dwelling place of God unto another; therefore ſay theſe interpreters, an ingagement to the Temple is no abſolute bond, and a man becomes not a debter, or a ſinner, in falt, though he decline ſuch an oath or ſolemn ingagement.</p>
            <p>But ſay they, he that ſwears by the gold of the Temple he is bound, and is in fault, and under ſin in caſe he decline his ingagement; by the gold of the temple we are to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand that which was laid upon it for ornament, <hi>Exodus</hi> 25. chap. Secondly, that which was the gold in the treaſury, <hi>Mark</hi> 12. 41. <hi>Luke</hi> 21. 1.</p>
            <p>Now for the golden ornament of the temple, wherein doth it conſiſt but in the offices and officers thereof; what is the temple without Prieſts, Levites, Nethinims, Porters, and Singers, <hi>Ezra</hi> 7. 24. <hi>Nehem.</hi> 10. 28. and what is a Church, in point of glory, without Paſtours, Teachers, Elders, and Deacons; or Prieſts, Elders, Scribes, Phariſes, and Lawyers: theſe ornaments men are bound and ingaged unto, or elſe not a Church in honour; but being deſtitute of them, they lie under cenſure and are in fault, therefore in their account and doctrine ingagement to the gold, is an abſolute bond up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the ſpirits of men.</p>
            <p>Again, for the riches of the treaſury, being the reception of all the gifts, <hi>Luke</hi> 21. 1. of the Church; where is that to be found but in the officers, who have received them from Schools, Counſels, Libraries, and laying on ſuch hands, as may as well advance a mans ſelf into a ſaddle, as raiſe up o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers thereinto, ſuch as are ingaged in this reſpect, they on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:40942:62"/>
are debters unto the diſpoſure of all the riches and excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lencies of the Church, ſo as others are not, and therefore are to have the benefit and the glory to redound unto them; ſuch is the doctrine of the ſcribes and phariſes concerning the gold of the Temple, both in the ornaments and treaſures thereof, ſo that they are the proper glory and riches, the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyneſs and the righteouſneſs of the houſe and Temple of God.</p>
            <p>But what ſaith the anſwer of God in Chriſt, ye fools and blind, that is, ye that are as deſtitute of, and as far from, the true principles and grounds of Gods wiſdome, as a natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral fool, or idiot, is from the uſe and exerciſe of the true principles and reaſon of a man; ye blind, or dark, not only dark becauſe light appears not, but if the Sun of righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs be ſet before your faces, ſtanding ſtill as once the ſun did in Gibeon, in Joſhuas time, <hi>Joſhua</hi> 10. 12. ye neither will nor can behold the glory of it, no more then thoſe carnal calf merchants could behold the face of Moſes, when he had been in the mount talking with God, <hi>Exod.</hi> 34. 30. and he proves it by argument that they are ſuch; for, ſaith he, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is greater, the gold, or the Temple which ſanctifieth the gold? whether is greater, that which makes holy, or that which is made holy? but it is the Temple that makes holy; therefore ye are fools and blind to prefer that which is made holy before it: for where are the ornaments of your offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, unleſs the Church (in your eſtimation) prefer you? and where are thoſe treaſures of gifts you have, if the Church have not diſtributed them unto you.</p>
            <p>Again, ye fools and blind, is not the Son of God he that makes holy, as well as he that is made holy, and are ye bound more ſtrictly to the one then the other, when as they are both one individual ſubſiſtance, <hi>Hebr.</hi> 1. 2, 3. <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 2. 14, 15. neither is there any place of glory, worſhip, or holineſs, but in that myſtical body (in Gods account, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 2, 16.) nor is there any gift, perſon place, or office, in that Temple and dwelling place of the moſt high, that is preferred in dignity one above another, ſave only, as Gods oportunity calls for preſent uſe and exerciſe of any of them, and that prefers
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:40942:62"/>
every one, or every thing, in Chriſt our true and only Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, to be chief and have preheminency in its proper time and place<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
               <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 3. 1, 11.</p>
            <p>Again, whoſoever ſwears by the altar it is nothing, but he that ſwears by the gift that is thereon he is a debter, that is, ſay theſe falſe interpreters, he that is ingaged to the altar may diſpence with his being preſent thereat, and his attend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance thereupon; even as there is a liberty in the alter it ſelf, to be erected not alwayes of the ſame materials; for ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times it is an altar of earth, <hi>Exod.</hi> 20. 24. and it is alſo an al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of wood, <hi>Exod</hi> 27. 1. Sometimes it is an altar of ſtone, <hi>Exod.</hi> 20. 25. and ſometimes an altar of braſs, <hi>Exod.</hi> 39 39. Yea, and ſometimes it is a golden alter, <hi>Exod.</hi> 39 38. and yet the truth is, the difference of the materials whereof the altar is appointed to conſiſt, gives not the leaſt liberty to diſpence with the bond or oath; ſo as to be freed of, or abſent from the altar in any reſpect. For the difference of the matter whereof the altar conſiſts, is only to declare unto us, that when Chriſt, Gods true and only memorial is erected and proclaimed unto the ſons of men in the world, when they through a miſconceiving ſpirit, and miſcarrying womb, <hi>Hoſea</hi> 9. 14. do caſt that memorial of God into a form car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal; and ſet up a ſtatue deſtitute of the life of God, then are the Saints of God by his authority and appointment to erect the worſhip of God, to conſiſt in things as far differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from their carved form, as wood differs from earth, and ſtone from wood, braſs from ſtone, and pure gold from braſs, and yet no declining nor departure from the altar in any reſpect.</p>
            <p>Hence it is that the Spirit of God in its metaphorical ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions by the prophets, in the appointments of the wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip of God (in holy Writ) by its elegant alluſions to things within the ſphere of humane capacity concerning the ceremonies and ſervices of the law, which carnal Iſrael un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding according to humane reaſon, framing and ere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cting forms unto themſelves accordingly. The ſame Spirit of God in the prophets thereupon, inveighs againſt them, cries them down, and diſanuls them, as being mans meer inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:40942:63"/>

            <p>Again, theſe falſe interpreters will confeſs that Chriſt is the true altar, becauſe the Apoſtle affirms ſo much <hi>Hebr.</hi> 13. 10, 11, 12. but their confeſſion is meerly verbals: for they ſay Chriſt is the altar only as he is God, and the ſacrifice as he is man, when as the truth is, there is no office or act, apper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining unto the Son of God, that can be aſcribed unto a nature which is not of twain made one, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 2. 15. for if God at any time, or in any thing, had reckoned himſelf one of, or abſent from, the ſon of man, no poſſibility had been left to have caſt up or found out another form, for he <hi>is the Lord that changeth not,</hi> Mallac. 3. 6.</p>
            <p>But theſe men ſay, however men may be ingaged to the altar; yet they are not bound alwayes to attend uoon, and be preſent with, the Lord Chriſt, who is the true altar; for he now only reſides in heaven, a place remote from the Saints on earth; as though <hi>Sh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

            <p>But the falſe interpretours affirm, that whoſoever ſwears by the gift on the altar he is a debter, or bound and ingaged thereby, that is, ſuch as are ingaged in the gifts laid on the altar, or exerciſed in the form of worſhip, as the gift of tongues, the knowledge of arts, the gift of forms of pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, or of preaching, exhortation, admonition, or reproof; they only who are inveſted into theſe, in the way of a Judai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal, Levitical and literal law, or law of the letter, that is, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to that humane order where they live, theſe are bound to the preſentation, exerciſe, and ordering of theſe gifts as their proper trade and calling, exempted from o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers of the houſhold of God: And that all the reſt of the people are ingaged unto theſe gifts, to yield their ſubmiſſion unto them, as alſo to maintain the parties thus gifted in the exerciſe of them, the parties alſo being gifts themſelves unto whom the people are bound and become debters, concluding that paſtours, teachers<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> prophets, Apoſtles, and Evangeliſts are given of God unto the reſt of the people, <hi>Jerem.</hi> 3. 15.

            <p>But what ſaith the anſwer of God to theſe men, ye fools and blind, that is, ye are fools and idiots with reſpect unto Gods wiſdome and manner of arguing, even as a natural fool void of reaſon, is not in a capacity to underſtand reaſon, neither to receive it or give it out; no more do you under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand the way of Gods wiſdome, either to propoſe it to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, or to receive and approve of it when it is propounded to you; ye are blind alſo, or in the dark, not for want of the light ſhining; for though the Son of righteouſneſs caſt out his beams upon you, <hi>Matth.</hi> 5. 45. ye perceive nothing, nay, ye turn light into darkneſs in your ſelves, <hi>And if the light that is in you be darkneſs, how great is that darkneſs,</hi> Matth. 6. 23. for <hi>the God of this world,</hi> that is, the wiſdome of this world <hi>hath blinded the minds of the infidels, that the light of the glorious goſpel of Chriſt, which is the image of God, ſhould not ſhine unto you, or ſhould not ſhine in you,</hi> 2 Cor. 4. 4. for the world by wiſdome, or in and through wiſdome, is ignorant of God, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1. 21.</p>
            <p>Now to evince this his taxation, he interrogates, whether is greater the gift, or the altar that ſanctifies the gift; he confounds them in their own wiſdome, to prove them fools and blind in the wiſdome of God: for in humane reaſon, that which makes holy muſt have the preheminency of that which is made holy by it, the Authour and Fountain is great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er then the product and the ſtream, ſo that to ſtrive againſt the wiſdome of God, brings a man to turn fool, even in hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane argument.</p>

to the order of Gods wiſdome, which is not extant in the truth and ſubſtance thereof but only in Chriſt, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1. 24. whence Chriſt infers a threefold argument for the concluſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of this point.</p>
            <p>Firſt, therefore whoſoever ſweareth by the altar, ſweareth by it and by all things thereon, that is, no man can be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged unto the true altar, the Son of God, in whom the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity is ſlain, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 2. 15 16, the fleſh kild and crucified in all the affections and luſts thereof, <hi>Galat.</hi> 5. 24, 25. but he muſt be ingaged and ſworn unto all things that belong and appertain to the Son of God; for himſelf and his furniture are inſeparably one, and can never be divided, whoſoever therefore is bound over unto God by faith in Chriſt, is bound over to the gift of prayer, propheſie, interceſſion, me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diation, to the gift of Paſtour, Teacher, Evangeliſt, Apoſtle, Prieſthood, Kingdome, and whatſoever appertaineth unto the Lord Jeſus that true altar, for the altar withont the gifts is uſeleſs and attains not its end, and what gift ſoever not found on that altar, is void of holyneſs and falls ſhort of acceptation before God and good men.</p>
            <p>Secondly, he inferres <hi>that whoſoever ſweares by the Temple, ſweareth by it and him that dwels therein,</hi> that is, he that is ingaged to the pallace, or place of Gods abode, which is the Church of God, made an habitation of God through the Spirit, that man is alſo ingaged and bound over unto the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitant and indweller, the Lord himſelf; for there is none ingaged unto the houſe of God, but by ingagement unto God himſelf; for they are not twain but one intire being, ſo that none can erect a houſe or habitation for God, but it muſt be framed in a capacity to ſute ſuch an inhabitant, who is incomprehenſible, which nothing can do in heaven or in earth, but only the Son of God, Jeſus Chriſt; and none can deſcribe an inhabitant fit to furniſh and fill ſuch a Temple or pallace, but it muſt be the Lord alone that can do it, when we ſet forth the Temple therefore in its true form and beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, we only declare the glory of Chriſt in that conſiderati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, therefore he ſaith <hi>deſtroy this Temple, and I will build it up in three dayes ſpeaking of his body,</hi> John 2. 19, 20, 21. not
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:40942:65"/>
only of his body doctrinal, born of the Virgin Mary, which may be conſtrued literally and carnally, as well as ſpiritually and heavenly, <hi>Iohn</hi> 6. 51, 58. but of his body myſticall com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehending all the Saints of God which if a man eat or com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate in, he lives forever.</p>
            <p>And when we deſcribe him that dwells in the Temple, we only ſet forth the glory of the Lord Jeſus, who dwels not in temples made with hands, that is of mans building according to humane reaſon and art, <hi>Hebr.</hi> 9. 11. for the heaven of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens cannot contain him, 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 8. 27. 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 6. 18. much leſs an houſe coupled together, according to thoſe mean and beggerly thoughts of men, whereby Churches are e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected in theſe dayes, which men may be bound too to day, &amp; looſe to morrow; which is all one to ſay a man may be faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and betrothed to Chriſt to day, and unfaithed and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vorced to morrow, which is no leſs then to fall away from grace, which ſuch builders ſeem to inveigh againſt: for the Temple and he that dwells therein are one, never to be ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parated, no more then God and man can be ſeparated in Chriſt, therefore ſuch phariſaical interpretours who erect Churches as true Churches of God, that admit of decay, and falling from God in whole, or any members thereof, are they who have deceived and undone the world from the foundation thereof, unto this day, and are the proper witches of the world which the Scripture intends; and that they may paſs without notice being taken of them, they expound the word ſo, as it may be applied to poor ſilly women, whom they can intangle and trap in their talk, and ſo make ſuch the guilty perſons and authours of miſchief.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>But the Temple and he that dwells therein is one, undi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided, and never was, nor ſhall be ſeparated, whatſoever the phariſes teach to the contrary, which our Apoſtle ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gantly declares, ſaying,</hi> and hath put all things under his feet, and gave him to be head over all things in the church, which is his body, the ful neſs of him thht filleth all, <hi>Epheſ 1. 22. 23.</hi> in whom all the building fitly framed together, groweth unto an holy temple, in the Lord in whom you are builded together, for an habitation of God in the ſpirit, <hi>Epheſ. 2. 21, 22.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:40942:65"/>
Thirdly, Chriſt uſeth another argument to evince the truth againſt theſe falſe interpretours, which is an explicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the former, ſaying, <hi>And he that ſweareth by heaven, ſweareth by the throne of God, &amp; by him that ſitteth thereon,</hi> that is, he that is ingaged and bound over as by oath unto hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, he is ingaged to the throne of <hi>God,</hi> that is, <hi>to</hi> the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly authority of the Son of God, <hi>Pſalme</hi> 132, 11, 12. and to him that ſits thereon, <hi>to ſit,</hi> is to abide and continue, or dwell, <hi>Pſalme</hi> 1. 1. <hi>Pſalme</hi> 2. 4. in the execution of that au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, the word tranſlated ſeat, or to ſit, ſignifies alſo, an aſſize, ſeſſion, or aſſembly for the uſe and skilful ordering and diſpoſing of all things, ſo the Hebrew word <hi>Moſhab</hi> is taken in <hi>Pſalme</hi> 107. 32. ſee what follows to the end of the Pſalme, the throne and him that ſits thereon, are one entire thing, for the unction is upon none, but Chriſt the anoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of God, and the exerciſe of this unction, cannot be found extant but in the Son of God alone.</p>
            <p>And whereas he brings in heaven and the throne of God to be one and the ſame, ſo that he that ſwears by heaven ſwears by the throne and him ſits thereon; it is to explicate his former argument, that as by heaven here, we are not to terminate our thoughts in theſe viſible heavens, or in any thing or place limited according to the bonnds of a creature, but according to the throne or authority of the Son of God; even ſo we are not to terminate our thoughts in a Temple or altar, in what ſence ſoever they may be taken, if their edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice and form were either erected, or ſhall paſs away in time, which is the doctrine of the phariſaical and falſe interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tours.</p>
            <p>But true interpretours terminate, the ſubject matter of their doctrine, in that ſtate of the Son of God, <hi>who is the first and the laſt;</hi> yea, it is he alone, <hi>who is, and was, and will be the ſame,</hi> Revel. 22. 13. Revel. 1. 8. out of whom, or out of which, the heart of man can never enter into reſt, <hi>Hebr.</hi> 4. 6, 11. And theſe deceitful prevaricatours of the law, in dividing Chriſt in matter of doctrine, they divide themſelves from Chriſt by unbelief.</p>
            <p>And thence is brought in the ground of the denunciation
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:40942:66"/>
of the fift wo laid down in the 23, 24. verſes; which conſiſts in their tything of mint, Annis, and Commin, and neglecting the weighty matters of the law, wherein obſerve,

               </list>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. For the firſt, they take tithe, and they alſo pay tithe, as Matthew, and like compared together, declare, for ſo the law appoints in tithing or taking the tenth, two things are to be conſidered, as the firſt born are known to be the Lords, in that they firſt open the womb, and none can deny but the right of inheritance belongs unto them: Yea, that firſt born of God Jeſus Chriſt, is known to be the Royal off ſpring of the moſt high, by opening the womb of eternal life unto us, or in us; ſo that none can call into queſtion the bleſſing of the birth-right, being he is deſcended of God.</p>
            <p>But the tenth, as conſidered in the flock or in the field, none can give a reaſon why the rod ſhould paſs upon this ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther then upon that, <hi>Levit.</hi> 27. 30, 32, 33. even ſo the ſons of God, as they ſpring out of the earth, and are formed of the ſlime and duſt of the ground, <hi>Gen.</hi> 2. 7. no man can give a reaſon, why the rod or ſcepter of Jeſus Chriſt ſhould fall in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the hand of this man rather then that, which God hath left in their ſins, and given up unto wrath, for by nature in that refpect, we are the ſame which they are, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 2. 3.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Again, the word tithe, or the tenth, comprehends all of that kinde which is preſented, even as the whole law is
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:40942:66"/>
comprehended in one of thoſe ten words (for ſo the phraſe is, <hi>Deut.</hi> 10. 4.) which God ſpake unto Moſes, for it is fulfil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led in this one word, <hi>love,</hi> Gal. 5. 14. Rom. 13. 10.</p>
            <p>The tenth alſo is taken for eternity, by the verdict of the word of God, the tenth generation is expounded to be eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, <hi>Deut.</hi> 23. 3. by the Spirit of God; ſo that the tenth comprehends all times and all things, which nothing but the Son of God can do, who only is <hi>that all in all,</hi> Epheſ. 1. 23. who is an inheritance falling by lot in way of tithe, <hi>Pſalme</hi> 16. 5, 6. as well as in way of a purchaſed poſſeſſion, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 1. 14. as really, as he is a ſon by adoption, taken out of the houſe of a ſtranger, as he is man, and a natural ſon, the true off-ſpring of almighty God alſo, as he is begotten of the father of lights, <hi>Iohn</hi> 1. 13 14. <hi>Iames</hi> 1. 17, 18.</p>
            <p>So that as the Hebrew word, <hi>Mas,</hi> is often uſed for tribute, ſignifies, ſufficiency, or enough, and is ſo tranſlated <hi>Deut.</hi> 15. 8. becauſe it gives an intereſt in him that payes it, and to all that he hath, if occaſion be; even ſo the tithe comprehends, an alſufficiency or enough of all thiugs whatſoever; which is not elſewhere to be found but only in Chriſt. Let earthly tithe-mungers who tranſlate the Goſpel into tranſient things: weigh this point well, and know they are theſe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceitful phariſes.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Add further that in tithes the prieſt is to pay tithe, as well as to receive it, for he is appointed to pay <hi>the tenth of the tenth,</hi> Nehem. 10. 38. Therefore the Spirit of God ſaith by Matthew, ye pay tithes of mint, Annnis, and Commin, ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to theſe hypocritical teachers or expounders of the law.</p>
            <p>But Luke hath it, ye tithe (as taking tithe) the Mint, the Rew, and all manner of green herbs, <hi>Luke</hi> 11. 42. So that they receive inferiour and baſe things of the people, as things acceptable unto God, and a ſatisfactory refreſhment and comfort to themſelves in lue of their labours, which have not the fulneſs of the fruits of righteouſneſs in them, which are by Jeſus Chriſt; and as they get an intereſt in mean, earthly, and carnal things, received from the people in Schools. Synods, Libraries, Counſels, and carnal caſes pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:40942:67"/>
unto them; which is the tenth received by them to live upon, as the life and ſufficiency of their miniſtry, which is as plainly preached unto the world, as the labours and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nevolence of the people is, and muſt be, the life of their bodies, or elſe their doctrine cannot be afforded unto them.</p>
            <p>So likewiſe, they pay tithes of like nature, giving them out into the chambers of that earthly houſe made with hands, that is to ſay, into perſons and congregations built up only in way of humane wiſdome; for when theſe things thus received, have paſſed in their hands under the rod or autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of Egypt and not of Iſrael, then they carry out the tenth as it falls in their ordering of it; as the proper ſtore provided by God for the food and refreſhment of the poor, ſtranger, fatherleſs, and widows, in an apiſh imitation of that houſe of God not made with hands, but eternal in the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens, <hi>Nehem.</hi> 10. 34, 39. <hi>Deut.</hi> 14. 28, 29. <hi>Deut.</hi> 26. 12. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 1.</p>
            <p>The things therefore thar theſe expounders of the law do receive, and pay as acceptable unto God, in point of tithing for, and to God, are mean and tranſitory; yea, there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing wherein their doctrine doth conſiſt, that ſhall be able to paſs under the natural death of the body with them; but their whole religion ends and periſheth there: for whereas the Apoſtle concludes, that now abides faith, hope, and love, theſe three, but the chiefeſt of theſe is love, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13. 13. they not underſtanding the Apoſtle in that (no more then in the reſt of his doctrine) do conclude that love is chief, becauſe it abides, and the others ceaſe, at the end of this life.</p>
            <p>But love, according to their ſence, ceaſeth alſo, for in this life (they teach) we love God in, and through another me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diatly, but then we ſhall love him immediatly, which is not only love in another reſpect, but alſo another kind of love, even as among men in humane love; a man may love a wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man as a neighbour, but to love her with a matrimonial love is love of another kind, ſo that their whole religion is to ſeek after death, yea love it ſelf, that conjugal virtue.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="47" facs="tcp:40942:67"/>

            <p>No man can deny, but that the whole word, and ſo the whole work of God is committed to every one of the ſons of men for the management thereof; even as certainly as the whole kingdome of Iſraels, and not a part, was commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted unto Saul in point of government, and it was the whole kingdome which was rent from Saul and given unto David, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 15. 26, 29. for the ordering and government thereof: for it is the difference of unction that breeds the difference of kingdomes in point of acceptation before God.

So that Saul hath the management of the whole kingdome, turned into a kingdome of darkneſs, by diſpoſing of it by that oyly ſupplement of mans wiſdome the headſhip thereof: But as it tranſlated unto David, it is managed by the wiſdome of God, that unction which teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth all things; preferring the things of God in the villifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of things humane, things eternal, not ſeen, by the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of man; villifying things which are ſeen<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and tranſitory, obvious to carnal ſence, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4. 17, 18. and upon Saul the anointed David will not lay his hand, that it may appear un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to all men that there is in that way of Rule, ſufficient matter of deſtruction in point of handling that ſword of the Spirit, which is the word of God, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 6. 17. turning it upon his own breſt for his own voluntary ruine, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 31. 4. 5. but when David, cut off a lap of Sauls garment, as a teſtimony that the honourable ornaments and robe of the kingdome was tranſlated unto him, through that holy unction of the Spirit he was touched in heart, that is, felt, and was really ſenſible (through that Spirit of God) of that weight of the glory of God, put upon him for the governing and or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering of all the things of the houſe and kingdome of God, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 24. 5. as all the Saints of God are, which partake of the ſame Spirit, <hi>Phil.</hi> 1. 27. though the ſpirit of Saul think ſo meanly of Davids hold, or cave; that he makes it a place wherein to uncover his feet, which baſe and mean ſpirit of Saul ends in the juſtification of Davids innocency, and vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dication of his glory, and the juſt condemnation and ſhame of his enemy, in the guilt of his own conſcience, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 24. read the whole chapter.</p>
            <p>To conclude this point, the whole word of God is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to every man in truſt for the interpretation of the whole, as really as in any part; for the law is full in one word as in all words, <hi>Gal.</hi> 5. 14. and there is a vacuity, and breach in all, if in any one, <hi>Iames</hi> 2. 10.</p>
            <p>He that interprets therefore by the rules of humane wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome,
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:40942:71"/>
which education and bringing up in the Schools may attain unto, he falſifies the word of God, not only in point but in all and every particular that concerns the glory of God in mans ſalvation by Chriſt; and whoſoever interprets according to the wiſdome and ſpirit of God, if he juſtifie the Son of God in any one point of the Goſpel, he is a ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filler of the whole law, even as John, and Jeſus, conſidered in that one act of baptiſme original, and miniſterial, the baptized; and the baptizer, do therein fulfil all righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs, <hi>Matth</hi> 3. 15.</p>
            <p>Wo be to him therefore, that neglects this weighty mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of the law, namely, fidelity in this truſt of the word of God committed unto him, the firſt ſtands in judging and deſerning of all things, the ſecond in the bounty and good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of all things; and the third, in the ſafe cuſtody and right diſtribution of all things, which Luke comprehends in two, that is, judgement, and the love of God, <hi>Luke</hi> 11. 42. to ſhew that the love of God (oppoſed to the love of the world, <hi>Iames</hi> 4. 4.) is the very original and fountain of all bounty, benignity, goodneſs, and mercy; out of which love there is none to be found; but every man ſeeks himſelf, or his own things, and none the things of Jeſus Chriſt, <hi>Phil.</hi> 2. 21. Again the love of God is the proper cauſe and foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, of all truſt and confidence, for true cuſtody and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation, and right diſtribution, and laying out of all things, without which there is none from whom we may expect mercy, nor in whom we may repoſe truſt, or have any af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fiance in at all.</p>
            <p n="4">4. The fourth point obſerved, wherein the doctrine of theſe ſcribes, together with their practice ought to appear; and that is<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> in doing theſe weighty matters of the law, and not leaving the other undone, wherein is contained two points.</p>
            <p>Firſt, that the matter of true information, and light breaking forth from the word of God, hath in it, as real re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proof and conviction to the wicked, as it hath true juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation and acquaintance therein unto the godly.

<pb n="56" facs="tcp:40942:72"/>
is the only way and means of condemnation to the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies of Chriſt, and that makes the friends of antichriſt, and lims of Satan, ſo fearful of that day which ſprings from an high, and ſo diligent to guard the world by humane orders, left it ſhould viſit the ſame, <hi>Luke</hi> 1. 78, <hi>Pſalme</hi> 2. 1, 2, 3. <hi>Acts</hi> 4. 26, 27.</p>
            <p>Secondly, the due obſervation of the prime weighty, and chief things in the law of God, is the only way and means of regulating, and bringing into orderly practice all inferi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our things whatſoever, whereas the preferring of mean and tranſitory matters, is the devaſtation and ruine of the whole order, and full intent of the law and work of God.</p>
            <p>And whereas men think the invalliding of all earthly things is the inlet of all diſorder, it is nothing ſo; but it hath the order of God in it, as he is the God of order and not of confuſion, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14. 33.

            <p>Seventhly, Chriſt is that Real faith, or ſubſiſtance of the Son of God, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3. 23. <hi>Heb.</hi> 11. 1. who as he is the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, ſo he is the <hi>end</hi> of all things, <hi>Revel.</hi> 22. 13.

if once we come to center our ſelves, together with God<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> in that Sonſhip of Chriſt, we ſhall find therein all things come to their higheſt end, glory, and perfection, as alſo all means alike glorious, and full of virtue and efficacy, to bring about thoſe holy and honourable ends, in their renewed and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued perfections, which looſens the ſoul from all the ſnare; and intanglements of this life, to betake it ſelf unto ſuch ends and means to affect them, as fail not, but dure forever; and ſo much at this time for the doing of the weighty matters of the law, and not to leave undone, ravel, make, ſpoil, or miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>place things of a far inferiour rank:</p>
            <p n="5">5. The fift particular noted in this wo, is a Severe charge, laid upon theſe falſe interpreters, calling them blind guides, that is, leaders without light in themſelves. or in any that follow them; yea, they are leaders or authorized perſons of darkneſs, having the power of the devils, being the ſame ſpirit or off ſpring of the ſerpent, that falſly expounded the word of God in the beginning, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 6. 12. and all their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue are of the ſame brood and off-ſpring; for he that teacheth and he that approves of the thing taught, ſpeaks the ſame thing, and are under the ſame condemnation; ſo that every one hath the ſame office, and are under the ſame guilt, of being the firſt opener of the gate or power of hell; and made the firſt inlet of the wrath of God upon mankind; being the proper authour and original of ſinking, all that e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver did, or ſhall deſcend into the pit of diſtruction; for the guilt, which is the condemnation of the wicked, never de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parts from the devil that old ſerpent, which is the ſpirit of the ſerpent, which was that ſpirit of falſe interpretation, is, and ſhall be for ever.</p>
            <p>So that every falſe interpreter, is the ground, original, and cauſe of all guilt and wrath of the wicked, and ſo the cauſe of the cruel crucification of the Lord of glory, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 28.</p>
            <p>Obſerve alſo, that whoſoever truly opens the word of God, according to the wiſdome of God, by that true and only interpreter the Spirit of God, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2. 9, 16 there is in that the true honour of the firſt act, and original opening of
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:40942:74"/>
the kingdome of God, the diſcloſure of the mind and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pening of the firſt thoughts ſpringing out of the boſome of eternity, the graving of Chriſt his true form, and bringing forth the Son of God from the womb of eternity, having the honour of ſalvation upon it; in all the ornaments there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, and without which act, ſalvation had never appeared; for it is meaſured according to the comprehenſion of Gods Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit and wiſdome, and not to be limitted to any thing of the creature, no nor confined to any preſincts of time, as with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in that compaſs to be effected; for then it were not an eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal work, the doing whereof gives being thereunto, and the being thereof conſiſts in effectual working; and ſo the means of ſalvation and the end accompliſhed are never ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated but in everlaſting conjunction in that myſtical body of Chriſt, as ſure as the Creatour and the creature are become one therein.</p>
            <p>Hence the Pſalmiſt ſaith, <hi>To the Lord the ſalvation; upon thy people thy bleſſing Sela<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </hi> Luke 22. 19. So that, that praiſe and honour, due and peculiar unto God in point of ſalvation, is upon the people of God: for he communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cates it with the ſon of man, <hi>and yet gives not his glory unto another;</hi> for as Chriſt affirms, <hi>I and my father are one,</hi> John 10. 30. Therefore the Prophet adds the Hebrew word <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lah,</hi> which hath the ſignification of <hi>elevation,</hi> or lifting up; that as man is exalted in the word of God, ſo his mind is to be raiſed in admiration, that God hath ſo made himſelf for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever.</p>
            <p>In concluſion of this point, obſerve that antichriſt is not to be confined to any one particular man, or devil, but every one of that ſpirit is the original and proper inlet of ſin, and inundation of Gods wrath into the world, 1 <hi>Iohn</hi> 2. 18. 22.</p>

            <p>Theſe men can carefully ſtrain out of office, ſuch as have not been trained up in ſome univerſity, and attained to or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders meerly humane; but they can ſwallow down thouſands that never came to the knowledge of the myſtery of God; nor the operations of his ſpirit, only expreſſed therein, and not elſewhere to be found.</p>

Therefore the Hebrew word <hi>Mizrak,</hi> and the Greek <hi>Phialee,</hi> hath the name of pouring out, as in abundance, ſo often uſed by the Apoſtle in <hi>Revel.</hi> the 16. in pouring out the cups, or viols of Gods wrath.</p>
            <p>Again, the word platter, or charger, in Hebrew <hi>Kegh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narah,</hi> and ſometimes <hi>Cappoth,</hi> ſignifies hollowneſs, as the hollow of the hand or of a ſpoon; as having a capacity to contain matter to be miniſtred for food, and the Greek word <hi>Trublion,</hi> uſed alſo by Chriſt, <hi>Matthew</hi> 26. 23. Inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mating it to be of ſuch capacity, that divers hands may be upon it, not only Chriſt to dip therein, but alſo Judas; the one exerciſed in the food of eternal life, the Spirit of God in propheſie, ſignifying aforehand what Judas ſhould do un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him; the other receiving a ſop of eternal death, in which Satan makes entire, who never reſts, till through diſſimula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion he hath betrayed the Lord Jeſus to his own diſtruction. In which platter, diſh, or continent of the word of God, the hands of all men are, either in reception of the food of eternal life, whereby they are ſtrengthened and fitted for the work of the Lord; or elſe they receive that bitter water of the curſe, to make them to ſwell and burſt with Judas, ſo as in him all hypocritical and diſſembling confeſſours are made known, <hi>Iohn</hi> 6 51. <hi>Numb.</hi> 5. 27. <hi>Acts</hi> 1. 18, 19. who ſeek only to purifie and cleanſe, according to the viſible and out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward form of expreſſions in the word of God, but never look into that hidden myſtry of that ſpiritual ſtate and body of Chriſt, which is the proper ſcope and intent of them all, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2. 7. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3. 4. <hi>Revel.</hi> 2. 17.</p>
            <p n="4">4. The fourth point is the manifeſtation of the inſide of
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:40942:77"/>
this manner of cleanſing, and that is, fulneſs of bribery and exceſs.</p>
            <p n="1">1. For they are full of bribery, or extortion: this word is of double ſignification, for it declares how falſe interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tours come to God in all their indeavours as directed unto him, and that is with a ſpirit of bribery; for in all their pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, faſts, thankſgivings, ſacraments, and ſervices, their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per indeavour is, to corrupt the Lord, even the God of Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice, and all purity in putting their ſervices into his hand, to divert him from judging according to the law of the Spirit, which they call hereſie, <hi>Acts</hi> 24. 14, and to draw him to judge of things according to the law of the fleſh, in which their proper cauſe depends and doth conſiſt.</p>
            <p>And hence it is that Balak and Balaam indeavoured what in them lay, by gifts, ſacrifices, ſervices, and ſouthſaying<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> to curſe that ſpirituall ſtate and camp of Iſrael, and to make it abominable, and themſelves acceptable before the Lord, read <hi>Numbers</hi> 22. and 23. chapters. And thus they are full of bribes inwardly, in that they give them with deſire to prevaricate the law of the Spirit, to eſtabliſh the law of the fleſh, which deſires and wiſdome of the fleſh are enmity a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt God, becauſe they are not ſubject to the law of God, neither indeed can be, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 7.</p>
            <p>Again, theſe men are alſo full of the receiving of bribes, for they do nothing but out of hope, and gain, and receiving reward, as they are related both to God and man; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſuch Balaamites are ſaid to have forſaken the right way, and are gone aſtray, following the way of that ſon of <hi>Boſſor,</hi> who loved the wages of unrighteouſneſs, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. 15. whereas the people of God, perform their works, not look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for any thing again, which diſtinguiſheth them from the mercinary ſinners and wicked of the world, by Chriſt his own teſtimony, <hi>Luke</hi> 6<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 34, 35, 36. Yea, the Saints act in all things as in that proper ſphere or element wherein their natural life conſiſteth, as they are of that fountain of Iſra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>el, <hi>Pſalme</hi> 68. 26. and that off-ſpring Royal, being the ſons of God, 3 <hi>Iohn</hi> 1. 12, 13.</p>
            <p>To whom it is as natural to be exerciſed in wayes of wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:40942:77"/>
and works of mercy, as for a father to lay up for his children or the Sun to ſhine in the firmament, without look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for any thing to be brought in thereby, and added unto it ſelf.</p>
            <p>For the Saints of God move to declare what they are through grace in Chriſt, and not to make themſelves to be ſomething, which as yet they are not, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. 14, 15. <hi>Pſalme</hi> 19. 4, 5, 6. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15. 10. for that according to which they reckon and account of themſelves; is of God and not of man, <hi>Galat.</hi> 1. 11.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Again, as the word bribe imports extortion, that fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thineſs alſo is in, theſe interpretours; in all their outgoings, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der pretence of being ſent out from God, for ſo they aſſume the names, titles, attributes, and offices, proper to the Lord Chriſt; as Biſhop, Paſtour, Teacher, Prieſt, Prophet, King, Lord, Ruler, and the like, which they extort violently, pull from, and rob the Lord Chriſt of, who never gave nor ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed thoſe terms, titles, and offices, to any that ſerves in the earthly tabernacles, or rule according to the carnal com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment, and tranſitory office and imployment; ſo that they are full of extortion and robbery alſo: for never was the name of any thing given by God, but the nature of the thing was found under it, elſe ſhould it be a vain title, and if the name of God be given to any, where his nature and ſpirit is not under it, there is found nothing but a vain Idol, or thing of nought, what ſhow or comportment ſoever it may ſeem to bear in the eye of the world.</p>
            <p>Laſtly, theſe interpretours, compared to cups and platters, are ſaid to be full of exceſs, and riot, and that in two re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects.</p>
            <p>Firſt, they are exceſſive in expending, for they volunta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily caſt off the Right of the firſt-born of God, for tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rary, vain, and corruptible things, meerly to ſatisfie their preſent ſenſual appetite, whetted and ſharpned up in them, by hunting after carnal things, which they tender unto God to procure a bleſſing, according to the law of the carnal commandment, and the right of the firſt-born after the fleſh, which God never appointed to be poſſeſſed with the
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:40942:78"/>
rights and priviledges of his houſe; for fleſh and bloud can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not inherit the kingdome of God, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15. 50.</p>
            <p>Theſe follow the ſteps of Eſau, who ſold the birthright for a meſs of red, earthly, or bloudy broth, <hi>Gen.</hi> 25. 30. for which he is called a fornicatour, becauſe he brings the word of bleſſing into conjunction with carnal things, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluding the conſervation of life conſiſts therein; and alſo, a profane perſon, in that he thinks ſo meanly and baſely of that right of the firſt-born of God, eſteeming that ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al inheritance in Chriſt, as nothing in reſpect of the ſatisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of the luſts of the fleſh, <hi>Hebr.</hi> 12. 16. falſe interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tours therefore are ful of exceſs in expending; (being the caſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>away,) the myſtry of the Goſpel, as a thing of no worth, by their ſo ſtrict and phariſaical ſtanding upon the outward and viſible form of the letter.</p>
            <p n="2">2. And thence ariſeth exceſs in them; in the ſecond place; in all their receptions they become riotous, for they will not give entertainment unto the Son of God in any thing, but they will joyn therewith the abillities of the creature; his power is nothing to them, unleſs the arm of fleſh be adjoyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, his wiſdome is nothing to them without humane pollicy; his righteouſneſs is naught worth, without one of an inferi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our rank to make it good to them, by laying hold of it, and what are his riches without the treaſures of this life? or his honour without the pomp and glory of this preſent world? Now if Chriſt be ſufficient in himſelf in all and every parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular, then all things added which are not his are ſuperflu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, and more then enough, brought in to make him ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable or proſperous: therefore theſe falſe interpretours in all their receptions are full of exceſs and riot, being they make themſelves drunk, and are beſotted with the things of this life, which are the ſubject matter of all their interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations, ſo that when this life ends, the word of God in point of all hopeful things, muſt needs come to a period, and ceaſe unto them; ſo that in this life only they have hope in Chriſt (by ſtating his ordinances and inſtitutions, in tranſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent things) and therefore of all men they are the moſt miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15. 19.</p>
            <p n="5">
               <pb n="69" facs="tcp:40942:78"/>
5. The fift point in the pronouncing of this wo, is a ſharp taxation in theſe words, <hi>thou blind phariſee;</hi> in which words, Chriſt doth collect all falſe interpretours, centring them in one, not only of this or that age of the world, but all ages: for there is but one falſe interpretour of the word of God, and that is he who abode not in the truth, but is a liar from the beginning; and there is but one falſe interpretation, and that is it which ſaith, that that ſhall make us wiſe and God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like, which God hath ſaid is death to do it, and that the wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome and Image of God is not yet complete and perfect in the Saints, but by eating or communicating in ſomething, it ſhall be made perfect hereafter.</p>
            <p>There is but one phariſaical blindneſs, which is that, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per only to the kingdome of darkneſs and ſtate of the devil, there is but one lying ſpirit goes out to deceive, but he will fill the mouths of all Ahabs Prophets, there is but one un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clean ſpirit, to whom Chriſt ſaith, what is thy name? <hi>ſingu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly,</hi> and he anſwers, <hi>my name is,</hi> in the ſingular number al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo, (but with this explanation and multiplication) <hi>Legion, for we are many,</hi> Mark 5. 9. my name is Legion for we are many.</p>
            <p>There is but one ſeed of Abraham, namely, Iſaac ſhall be called thy ſeed, meaning Chriſt, of whom the Apoſtle in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terprets it, but this ſeed is multiplied as the ſtarres of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven for multitude.</p>
            <p>And there is but one ſeed of the ſerpent, or of Iſhmael, but it is multiplied as the duſt of the earth for multitude.</p>
            <p>There is but one light whereby a true interpretour per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives the viſion: for in thy light ſaith the Pſalmiſt, we ſee light, but it is multiplied in all the diſciples of Chriſt: there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he ſaith, ye are the lights of the world, there is but one vail of darkneſs or ſhadow of death, but it is multiplied into every heart, wherein Moſes, only according to the letter, is Characterized or read, 2 Cor. 13, 14, 15. <hi>Thou blind pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſce,</hi> there is but one, and yet this one is multiplied into all ignorant and unskilful interpretours of the word of God that ever were, are, or ſhall be, which makes but that one kingdome of darkneſs and of the devil: So that the woman
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:40942:79"/>
Jeſabel, or that mother of harlots, may as well ſay by vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue of that conjunction of the harlot, draw me, and we will run after thee, as uttering her ſelf in the prince of the power of the aire, who now works in the children of unbelief.</p>
            <p>As the Spouſe of Chriſt, by virtue of her contract with the Lord Chriſt, can ſay, draw me, (as the only one) and we will run after thee; as all the choice ones of God, who are of the ſaith of the Lord of life and glory.</p>
            <p>To conclude this point, blind handling the word of God is but one, blinde handling the word of God is diſperſt into many, and yet there was never unity in Satan; for he is ever devided and at contradiction in himſelf, therefore his king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome cannot ſtand, but is perpetuated in its falling from God.</p>
            <p>Nor was there ever diviſion in Chriſt, but is at unity and peace with himſelf, and therefore his kingdome is firm and eſtabliſhed unto eternity.</p>
            <p n="6">6. The ſixt particular is an exhortation in way of rebuke, for their ſo prepoſtrous practice in theſe words, firſt cleanſe the inſide of the cup and platter, wherein obſerve two things:</p>
            <p>Firſt, that Gods order and manner of working in all true miniſtry, chiefly conſiſts in purifying the inſide of things which appears not unto any natural or humane view, that is, to preſerve and keep undefiled the hidden man of the heart, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3, 4<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that ſecret, and myſtical body of Chriſt Jeſus, <hi>Col.</hi> 1. 27. which is ſpiritual and eternal, not ſeen with any temporary or carnal eye, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4. 18. being that great conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent and cup of Gods grace and ſalvation, <hi>Pſalme</hi> 116. 13. ſo as no ſpot, wrinkle, or blemiſh be found therein, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 5<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 27. no not in any part thereof, nor at any time, in any caſe that may concern it, or by any means that can be uſed to po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute, or in the leaſt defile or ſtrain it, in the ſight of God or any good man.</p>
            <p>And as it is with man, chiefly to look to the inſide of veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels unto which things of worth are committed, ſo it is Gods chief, principal, and firſt intent, that the myſtry of God in Chriſt, into which all the chief things of his kingdome are
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:40942:79"/>
conſigned, ſhould be preſerved and kept in purity, without all ſtain or putrifaction, and this is ſuch a ſecrecy or inſide of all things, as no mortal eye can ſee into, <hi>Iob</hi> 28. read the whole chapter, to know how to cleanſe it; for as the ſeed of which the Saints are conceived and born, is not mortal, but immortal ſeed, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 23. even ſo the light by which the Saints do ſee<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> is not a mortal, but an immortal light, <hi>Pſalme</hi> 36. 9. 1 <hi>Cor,</hi> 2. 9, 10.</p>
            <p>Obſerve from this point, that whoſoever hath a form of teaching, holding a certain reſidency of ſin (for a time, and ſtain of corruption) in the myſtical body of Chriſt, or any of the veſſels of mercy appertaining thereunto, <hi>Rom.</hi> 9. 23. <hi>Acts</hi> 9. 15. unto that man the Lord Jeſus utters theſe words, (and in him to all of that ſpirit) thou blind Phariſee, the chief and only thing is, to cleanſe the inſide of the cup and platter.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The ſecond thing thing to be noted in this point is this, that in what term or phraſe ſoever the word of God doth utter it ſelf, it is a ſharp and ſevere rebuke unto all falſe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretours of the Scriptures; here is an exhortation utter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, as a ſharp and bitter rebuſte, of blindneſs in them to whom it was given; even as Chriſt ſaid to Judas, when he had given the ſop, with which Satan entred: what thou doſt (ſaith he) do quickly, not as approving<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Judas his act, but to declare his reſtleſs and inſtant ſpirit, through the inſtigations of the devil, to work wickedneſs.</p>
            <p>It is not as vain men think, that the word of God only rebukes men when they ſommons in a uſe of reproof; no, in what manner or form ſoever the word of God is uttered in way of true interpretation, whether in way of exhortation, revelation, counſel, comfort a word of wiſdome, or know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, in promiſes, covenant, ſonſhip, or right of inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance; rightly explained, and faithfully and ſeaſonably ſet forth, they are all rebukes, reproofs, ſentences of death, and juſt acts of execution unto, and upon all wicked men; for they are ſtill wandring in the wayes of Cain, and with Balaam they ever love the wages of unrighteouſneſs, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. 14, 15, <hi>Iude</hi> 11. Therefore the whole word of God, as it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:40942:80"/>
the curſe, either expreſſed or incluſive, appertains and belongs unto them, for the word of God cannot be divided, no more then God himſelf can be divided, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1. 13.</p>
            <p>Therefore in whatſoever the word of God expreſſeth it ſelf in, unto the Saints, they find a moſt ſweet and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable intelligence therein; all and every ſentence be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes Goſpel unto them, teſtifying unto them from what they are delivered, and into what they are delivered in which twain conſiſts that harmonious mellody of the kingdome of God<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
               <hi>Pſalme</hi> 16. 10, 11.</p>
            <p n="7">7. The laſt particular noted in this <hi>Wo,</hi> is what would in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>evitably follow, in caſe the myſtery of the Goſpel were kept pure, if the inſide were cleanſed, in theſe words, <hi>That the outſide may be clean alſo:</hi> wherein obſerve, that there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing can keep men from defiling and being defiled in the ſight, and according to the judgement of men; but only, the conſervation of the hidden myſtery of God in Chriſt, in its native, original and eternal purity, which only conſiſt in the faith of the Goſpel, a ſecret, hid from the world from the foundation thereof, only made manifeſt in the Saints, <hi>Coll.</hi> 1. 24, 25, 26.</p>
            <p>Obſerve in this point, that the myſtry of the Goſpel is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver kept pure, when the word of God is terminated in any thing whatſoever that is inferiour unto, or below the Son of God; for as <hi>Jeſus comes forth from God, and goeth to God,</hi> John 13<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 3. even ſo the word of God, which word he is, <hi>Iohn</hi> 1. 1. <hi>Revel.</hi> 19. 12, 13. comes forth from the wiſdome of God, and terminates it ſelf in nothing, but in that wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of God, which is not found elſewhere, but only in Chriſt, <hi>Job</hi> 28. 12, 28. for that wiſdome he only is, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1. 24.</p>
            <p>For in whatſoever we terminate the word of God, which is the proper character and form of his mind and will, (from which himſelf can never depart) unto that thing what ever it be, we neceſſarily aſſign a Deity, and ſo bind over our ſelves to the worſhip of it, in way of love, or fear, deſire, hope, truſt, in it; or delight therein<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> or the like: and it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a thing inferiour to the Son of God, it is nothing elſe
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:40942:80"/>
but bowing down to an Idol, and thence it is that men are taxed for worſhipping the Sun, the Moon, and the whole hoſt of heaven, <hi>Deut.</hi> 4. 19. <hi>Deut.</hi> 17. 3. 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 21. 3. <hi>Amoſe</hi> 5. 25, 26. becauſe they lodge the word of God in ſuch inferiour things, as being the ſcope and drift there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, &amp; do not take all things below the Son of God as meer plankerings or pavements, upon which our minds may paſs unto Chriſt.</p>
            <p>For there is nothing in the viſible heavens and earth, wherein Gods proper intent is terminated, in the framing thereof, nor have they or any of them, either the good or the evil in them, which holds proportion with the mind and intent of him that formed them, but become ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther good or evil, according to the mind that paſſeth up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them, for <hi>unto the clean all things are clean, but unto them that are defiled and unbelieving, nothing is clean, but even their minds and conſciences are defiled,</hi> Titus 1. 15.</p>
            <p>So that to terminate the word of God in any thing ſhort of Chriſt, is to attribute a certain divinity unto that thing, ſetting that in the place of Chriſt which is not he, and that is Idolizing the creature, which is that ſpirit of fornications and uncleanneſs, ſo deteſtable unto God in all ages; for it gives that to the creature which apper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains to the Creatour, therefore the Apoſtle ſaith, there are gods many, and lords many, which men according to the letter and outſide of the cup and platter, impute power and authority unto; but unto us there is but one God, even that father or fountain of all things which we count upon, and we in him, as being made a fountain together with him, and one Lord Jeſus Chriſt, as being the end of all things, and we in him, as being made the end of all things together with him, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 8. 5, 6.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="74" facs="tcp:40942:81"/>
If the myſtery of the Goſpel be kept pure, as Chriſt being the proper end of the law, that is, of all things, relations, and reſpects whatſoever, and elſewhere we lodge not the word of God as in its ſphere or center, then is the letter rightly managed and all things become clean unto us.</p>
            <p>But if we lodge the word of God, as having its ſcope in any inferiour ordinance or appointment, which is not the Son of God himſelf, we then falſifie and corrupt the myſtery of God, by Idolizing and adoring the creature, defiling our ſelves by Idolatry, and ſo all things become unclean unto us.</p>
            <p>And we are found falſe interpretours of the word of God, by waſhing the outſide of the cup and platter, in that we put a gloſs of divinity upon terrene and tranſient things, and thereby corrupt and defile unto our ſelves, and others, that inſide, or hidden myſtry<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> of God in Chriſt Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus, who is the proper ſumm and ſubſtance of all things, wherein the word of God expreſſeth it ſelf.</p>
            <p>And from hence he brings in the ground of the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth wo pronounced, laid down in the 27. and 28. ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, that is, they are like whited tombes, which appear beautiful outward, but are within full of dead mens bones and all filthineſs, wherein obſerve two things:
<list>
                  <item>
                     <hi>1.</hi> Firſt, a deſcription of falſe interpretours, under the Metaphor of a grave, with reſpect unto what it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears outwardly, and what it is really wi hin.</item>
                  <item>
                     <hi>2.</hi> An application of the doctrine according to the true intent of the Metaphor, to ſhew the nature and condition of deceitful interpreters of the word of God.</item>
               </list>
            </p>
            <p>

Firſt, they are deſcribed under the Metaphor of a grave, ſepulchre or tomb; and firſt for their outward ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance, they are whited tombs, or as the word imports, painted monuments; for as in the former wo<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> their clean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs on the outſide is ſet forth, and their filthineſs within, ariſing there from; ſo now in this Metaphor he ſhews the form they have on the outſide of this ſepulcher, and what is the matter and form within, they are therefore painted or ingraven monuments, now we know that the painting or ingraving of a picture upon a tomb, is only to ſet forth a reſemblance of him that is not, <hi>Gen</hi> 42. 36. but is turned to duſt under that ſhadow that is ſet up to appear to men; for if the party had been alive, to make himſelf manifeſt in his proper feature and abillities, that painted form had not been there; ſo that it is the death of the party that brings forth the picture, to declare that ſuch a one was, but is not, or in hope, that in time he will riſe, return, and live again.</p>
            <p>Right ſuch is the practice of falſe and hypocritical in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretours, they draw out forms and pictures of Chriſt (as one that hath been, or will come) in carnal ordinan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, as in momentany Churches, offices, and officers, ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments and outward ſervices, ſet up as certain pictures, or ſhadowiſh forms of him, who in their true account, at preſent, and in point of reality of his preſence with them, <hi>is not;</hi> for, in caſe he were alive in them, he would not need ſuch pictures and formed reſemblances to ſet forth or make manifeſt his lively operations, and vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous ſufficiencies, which ever abide and are really reſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent with him.</p>
            <p>Therefore where ſuch pictures and painted forms of tranſient and terrene things, are ſet forth and ma ntained, Chriſt doth by this Metaphor, declare and publiſh to all the world, that he is dead in all ſuch hearts, as are the
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:40942:82"/>
minters and maintainers of ſuch things; for the ground and reaſon of all ſuch works, is, becauſe he is not alive in any of his virtues, inſtitutions, and eternized ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances, peculiar unto that his myſtical body; and becauſe he is dead in them, and they dead to him, in all the life and power of his ſpirit: therefore they draw out ſuch pictures, and monuments of him, whilſt their doctrine is the proper ſepulchre, wherein his myſtical body is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumed, and turned to rottenneſs, in regard of any life or virtue thereof appearing, or exerciſing it ſelf in any ſuch interpretour.</p>
            <p>And there Chriſt lies under the ſtone or ſtrength of Herod, <hi>Matth.</hi> 27. 60 <hi>Iob</hi> 6. 42<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> his authority, as alſo under the ſeal or ſecreſie, of Pylates ſubtil and phariſai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal miniſtry, <hi>Matth.</hi> 27. 62, 66. unto ſuch time as the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gel of God fowl aſide that heavy ſtone of the earthly ſtrength and authority of Herod, and break open that ſeal and ſecreſie of the myſtry of iniquity, that the Son of God may be made manifeſt by his reſurrection, to be ſuch a one, as no ſuch earthly thing contain, <hi>Romans</hi> 1. 4.</p>
            <p>We conclude then, according to the intent of Chriſt in taking up this Metaphor of a painted tomb or monu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, that where temporary inſtitutions are limned and drawn out, as being the ſubject matter of the word of God, there the Son of God is not, but is dead and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted thence in regard of all his properties, virtues, and operations, which accompany ſalvation; for ſuch do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine is the proper grave wherein Chriſt hath been buri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in all ages, ſince the foundation of the world; and the letter, or outward form of words in the word of God, reſolved to be Gods proper intent, hath been the proper engine wherewith Satan hath not only tempted, but alſo overcome the ſons of men from the foundation
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:40942:82"/>
of the world, which is apparent in that threefold tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion wherewith he aſſaults Chriſt; and Chriſt giving the true intent and interpretation, gives Satan the foil and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verthrow, in his compleat myſtical body: for the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle affirms, that the temptations of Chriſt, and the iſſue of them are in like ſort in all his myſtical body, without ſin, <hi>Hebr.</hi> 4. 15.</p>
            <p>It is good to conſider wherein the grave conſiſts that Chriſt is buried in, as though he were not, <hi>Ierem.</hi> 31. 15. <hi>Gen.</hi> 42. 36. Leſt whilſt we ſet up our monuments, and prepare clean linnen clothes, with all reſpect and modeſty in purified and reformed humane ordinances, and put the body in a new ſepulcher hewn out of a rock, or new pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er ſet up which hath not formerly appeared, and roll a ſtone, or exerciſe that earthly power to keep him ſafe in that buried condition; We do no more in all this, then Joſeph of Arimathea did, who was a diſciple, but feared the Jews, and Nichodemas, who was but a night diſciple, leſt he ſhould loſe his honour among the Jews, being both juſt and honourable in the Jews account; and therefore would do nothing in that point of Chriſts burial but by their leave, and performed the ſame according to their cuſtomes: we may uſe great diligence, begging and peti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioning, modeſty and humane, or Jewiſh purity; making uſe of new hewen out rocks of authority, and ſtones of ſtrength, to effect our deſires, intents, and purpoſes, and yet all may amount to no more then the endeavours of theſe men, namely, to keep Chriſt in ſome new hewen out, and formed earthly condition, ſo as none may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move him from thence, but under penalty, <hi>Matth.</hi> 27. 57, 66. <hi>Mark</hi> 15. 42. <hi>Iohn</hi> 19. 38. <hi>Luke</hi> 23. 50. with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect unto their ſo religious power, <hi>Iohn</hi> 19. 10.</p>
            <p>And with reſpect nuto ſuch Jewiſh purifications, in their deifying of humane and carnal ordinances, Luke brings in the ſentence in differring phraſes, ſaying; <hi>Wo to you ſcribes

and phariſes<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> hypocrites, for ye are as graves, which appear not, and the men which walk over them perceive not,</hi> Luke 11. 44. Declaring plainly, that men as they are indued with humane wiſdome, and ſecular learning, may travel and walk conſtantly, over doctrine ſpringing from like principles, and never perceive thoſe groſs and filthy abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minations which lie hid under the ſame.</p>
            <p>Chriſt therefore perceiving their outward trappings, paintings, and pargeting humane traditions with the name of God, to make them acceptable for the deluding of carnal minds; he openeth their inſide unto the world and tells them, that theſe graves, however they may ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear to ſimple men unlearned in the myſtry of God, yet in truth <hi>they are full of dead mens bones and of all filthineſs and uneleaneſs.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. Now we know that when men rif<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>le into a grave where nothing appears but dead mens bones, they appear in a confuſed heap; there is no order nor comlineſs to be found among them, they are ſcattered<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> from the original unity of all things; yea, they are therefore Babylon, with reſpect unto that Jeruſalem, which is compact, and a city in unity with it ſelf forever, <hi>Pſalme</hi> 12<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>. 3. ſuch is the condition of all them where falſe interpretation of the word of God takes place, there is not a jot of Gods or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, or unity to be ſound amongſt them.</p>
            <p n="2">2. They are dead bones alſo, being deſtitute of any marrow, wherewith to oil the points for motion, they move not in the way of God, <hi>Pſalme<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

any capacity of conjunction, with that which is the on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ornament of the ſons of men, which is the ſon of God, <hi>Pſalme</hi> 3. 3. no more then dead mens bones are capable of unity with fleſh, and blood, vains, ſinews, muſcles, arte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, and the like.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Secondly, he tells them, that as graves, they are full of all filthineſs and uncleanneſs; whereſoever doctrine is not filled with the marrow of the Spirit of God, there is a defiling and corrupting of all the holy things of God: for as Chriſt ſanctifies and makes holy mans nature in himſelf<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> which otherwiſe is unholy and unclean; even ſo antichriſt, by falſe doctrine in miſconceiving of the word of God<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> makes that unholy and filthy in himſelf, which otherwiſe is moſt holy and undefiled, <hi>Mallac.</hi> 2. 11. <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zekiel</hi> 22. 26. For as Chriſt ſaith in like caſe, if the light that is in you be darkneſs, how great is that darkneſs, <hi>Matth</hi> 6 23. for there remains nothing to inlighten it, or cure it, if the light be darkneſs it ſelf.</p>
            <p>So likewiſe if their paintings and pargettings, their pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity and cleanneſs, in their whited tombs, and gloſſes ſet upon their doctrine, amiable and delightful in the eye of humane reaſon, be nothing elſe in the truth of the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, but rottenneſs, putrifaction, and corruption: how great is that uncleanneſs when there remains nothing to cure it: for their cure is the proper corruption for their proper way of cure is to turn the truth of God into a lie, <hi>Rom.</hi> 1. 5. by terminating the word of God in vaniſhing things, which is to erect avain Idol, for it is all one to deny the Son of God to be the only Authour of all things, as to deny him to be the only end of all things.</p>
            <p>For we may as well and ſafely conclude, that ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing in the word of God comes from ſome other then the Son of God, <hi>Iohn</hi> 1. 12. who is the only mind, wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome,
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:40942:84"/>
conſiſtance, and exſiſtance of the father, as to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude, that any thing in the word of God points at, any thing ſhort of, or inferiour to, the ſame Son of God, in its proper intent and ſcope, then the which nothing can be greater Idolatry, either in one reſpect or in the other; for he only is that <hi>Alpha, and Omega, the firſt, and the l<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ſt, the beginning and the end,</hi> Revel. 22. 13.</p>
            <p>All things therefore, are from Chriſt as their Authour, and to Chriſt as their end and in him in their exerciſe, <hi>Rom.</hi> 11. 36. <hi>For we know that an Idol is nothing in the world,</hi> 1 Cor. 8. 4. but a meer vainifying or falſifying of the word of God, which is indeed the devil, 1 <hi>Corinth.</hi> 10. 19 20. 21.</p>
            <p>To conclude this point, falſe interpretours are corrupt and unclean, by defiling the holy things of God, turning the glory of God into ſhame, <hi>Rom.</hi> 1. 21. 25. by deny<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Chriſt, the right of inheritance and preſent poſſeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of all things, whether office or execution<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> within the confines of his kingdome, which is no other then that Spirit of Saul, that ever denies David the preſent right and poſſeſſion of the whole kingdome of Iſrael in all the adminiſtrations thereof, whatſoever, <hi>Pſalme</hi> 4. 2. for to attribute or deſign an office, or adminiſtration, to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther beſide Chriſt, is to defame and callumniate the Son of God; as though he were unworthy of it, or wanted power and skill to accompliſh and perform it; or as one being in exile, and not really preſent to undertake it, which muſt either deny the incomprehenſible vertue of his myſtical body, or elſe ſuch officer muſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude the Spirit of Chriſt out of the world in their dayes, and then themſelves muſt of neceſſity work by another ſpirit then his body is quickned by<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

2. The ſecond general point noted in this wo, is the application of the Metaphor, according to its real intent, declaring the nature of the doctrine of falſe interpretours in the inſide thereof, not diſcerned by humane learning, or the traditions of men: therefore they are ſaid to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear righteous before men, becauſe it is the letter that kils which they teach, which comes within the capacity of mans wiſdome, according to the judgement and wiſdome of God, and therefore it can never ſtand before his tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bunal, <hi>Pſalme</hi> 1. 5. however men of like principles judge them to be righteous, which is only in appearance with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the reallity thereof.</p>
            <p n="1">1. For in truth they are full of hypocriſie, that is, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit and guile, being of the ſame ſpirit which beguiled Eve at the firſt, as ſhe is the mother of all living accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the fleſh<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6. 16. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 21. 3.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Again, they are full of iniquity, unequal and une<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven in all things<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> they never reconcile the word of God, ſo as to have alike weight and worth in it ſelf all things, and of like uſe in all the Saints of God, who are all Kings, and all Prieſts, all firſt-born, all ſervants, and all freemen of the city of God, <hi>Revel.</hi> 5. 10. <hi>Hebr.</hi> 12. 23. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7. 22.</p>
            <p>They cannot give like dignity unto the Son as to the father at all times and in all things, as having received the inheritance, and hath the diſpoſure thereof in all things, as truly it is the donation of the father, which twofold act can ſtand together in Chriſt, though not in earthly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation, nor carnal mind; and that perpetually, they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not maintain a King of Saints, as one having rule of all, and alſo a brotherhood of firſt-born, having an equal ſhare, intereſt, and act in all; yet both can ſtand toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in Chriſt, they cannot make the woman ſubject unto the man, obeying Abraham, calling him Lord, as giving him all honour, and yet make her the mother of all the
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:40942:85"/>
Iſrael of God, as coming down from heaven, having no more help of man, then the Virgin hath who knows not a man, in the conception and bringing forth of the Son of God; or as Deborah, who bears away the glory of the field, they know not how to make the husband and the wife of equal authority, that howſoever Pharaohs daughter forſakes her fathers houſe and kindred, to ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit only unto the glory, wealth, and wiſdome of Solo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon; yet it is ſhe that conſtitutes her ſons as princes in all lands, <hi>Pſalme</hi> 45. as though no husband were concerned in any of them.</p>
            <p>They cannot make the condition of a widow ſo honour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able as a wife, which ſhe is if ſhe be a widow indeed, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 5. 3. For as her firſt husband, (the law of the car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal commandment) is dead unto her, ſo the rule and go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment of the whole houſe of God is upon her not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſubject to any Tutour or governour; but hath the power in her own hand and in her diſpoſe, which is no leſs honourable then Sarah to acknowledge Lordſhip and obedience.</p>
            <p>Yea, the woman can order and diſpoſe of all things in the family; yea, clothe her husband and houſhold in ſcar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>let, ſo that he is known by her when he ſitteth in the gate, <hi>Prov.</hi> 31. 10, 31.</p>
            <p>The interpretours cannot ſee alike riches and honour in the diligence of a ſervant, as in the command and au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of the maſter, they cannot make a child newly born, and a ſon newly given, to be the everlaſting father, with an eternal government upon his ſhoulder. The mighty God, the prince of peace, <hi>Iſay</hi> 9.</p>
            <p>Theſe things are parables unto carnal reaſon, the rule by which falſe interpreters work by; and therefore can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:40942:85"/>
make equal and even the things of God, not knowing alike worth in the Son of God, in whatſoever he is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed.</p>
            <p>They are full therefore of iniquity, inequality, and partiality, aſcribing excellency, or baſeneſs to things, as it may ſerve only for the excellency and glory of the fleſh, in maintaining an earthly, fading, and tottering kingdome.</p>
            <p>For they know not how to exalt every valley, nor how to bring low every mountain and hill, and to make the crooked ſtreight, and the rough places ſmooth and plain; and therefore cannot make in the deſert a path for our God, <hi>Iſay</hi> 49 3 4. and as they cannot equalize, nor skilfully poiſe, and make of like worth and weight all things in the word of God.</p>
            <p>No more do they know how to reconcile, or bring into agreement and mutual love and peace God and man, but leave them at a perpetual jar and enmity, and ſo are full of iniquity, as it is conſidered ſin, in miſſing of Gods mind and intent; or as it may imply puniſhment for ſin, procured and brought down upon men thereby, <hi>Gen.</hi> 15. 16. <hi>Exod.</hi> 20. 5. <hi>Levit.</hi> 7. 18. falſe interpretation is full both of the one and the other.</p>
            <p>The laſt thing to be obſerved in this point of applica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Metaphor of the grave, unto the preſent pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe and perſons is this, that whatſoever the wiſdome of God takes up and makes uſe of for the expreſſing of it ſelf, whether things in heaven or in earth, or under the earth, whether relations, repreſentations, or acts done, whether they appear to be evil or good, acceptable, or lothſome in the judgement of man, as a grave becomes both, it is a thing acceptable to bury the dead out of our
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:40942:86"/>
ſight, <hi>Gen.</hi> 23. 3. 4. and it is lothſome to open and behold the putrifactions of the creature, even of our own kind, as in this place; whatſoever it be that the word of God ſounds in, or utters it ſelf by, it is never brought into its proper ſence, nor interpreted according to its proper in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent, till it be brought unto the ſtate and condition of mankind, and ſo unto the ſtate of the Son of God, which the firſt man is ſaid to be, <hi>Luke</hi> 3. 38. which is found either in a ſtate of death, as falſe interpretours crucifie him afreſh unto themſelves, <hi>Hebr.</hi> 6. 6. or elſe in a ſtate of life, as riſen from the dead, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 34. <hi>Coll.</hi> 3. 1. for man is either to be conſidered in the word of Gods wiſdome, poſſeſſed with eternal life, according to the proper nature of that word; or elſe the Son of God is formed by mans wiſdome, and ſo mortallized in, and unto man; whereby man comes to be poſſeſſed with an eternal death: and theſe two conditions utter them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the world, from the foundation thereof, for the preaching of a true Apoſtle <hi>is not in the inticing words of mans wiſdome, but in plain evidence of the ſpirit and of power,</hi> 1 Cor. 2. 2. <hi>it is not the wiſdome of this world, neither of the princes of this world that comes to naught; but we ſpeak the wiſdome of God in a myſtry, even the hid wiſdome, which God hath determined before the world to our glory,</hi> 1 Cor. 2. 6, 7.</p>
            <p>So that as the word of God ſprings originally from the form of Gods wiſdome in Chriſt, who is the true mind and manifeſtation of the father, and fountain of all things. So it terminates it ſelf in nothing, (as its proper ſcope and true intent) but in the ſame form of Gods wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome in the Son; and we may as well conclude that ſome of the words of God in the beginning were framed by ſome other wiſdome then the wiſdome of God, which were to frame and ſet up a groſs Idol in the place of God, for the Pſalmiſt affirms <hi>that in wiſdome of God made
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:40942:86"/>
them all,</hi> Pſalme 104. 24. as to conclude that the word of God lodgeth it ſelf in any thing, as its proper intent and aim, ſave only that form of Gods wiſdome, which he hath only contrived in his Son Chriſt, and is not elſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where to be found; and a like indignity is offered unto the Son of God, in denying him to be the end of all things, as to deny him to be the Authour and beginning of all things, as he is that everlaſting father, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 9. 6. thoſe then, who build tranſitory fabricks, by ingaging mens conſciences, unto the labour of the work by the word of God, as by intending the erecting of that fading form, they do nothing elſe but bleſs an Idol, <hi>which is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing in the world,</hi> 1 Cor. 8. 4. for it is the vanifying of the word and work of God to themſelves and ſuch as fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low them; therefore ſuch falſe interpretours are ſuch as bring their brethren to deſtruction, or <hi>perdition,</hi> therefore the Apoſtle uſeth the ſame word to ſuch Idol worſhipers and interpretours, ſignifying what their word brings them unto, namely, to the ſtate of Jadas where the ſame word is uſed of him, <hi>Rom.</hi> 14. 15. <hi>Iohn</hi> 17. 12. which term is given to Antichriſt, 2 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 2. 3. and to all antichriſtians; 2. <hi>Pet.</hi> 3. 7. yea, to the devil himſelf, <hi>Revel.</hi> 9. 11. as the original end and acter of, and in them all, with whom we leave all deceitful interpretours, and cloſe with the text in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended, recorded for our learning in the 29. verſe of this chapter, the words are theſe,</p>

            <p>There is wretchedneſs in point of deprivation of all goods, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3. 10, 11, 12.</p>

2. The ſecond point is the perſons in whom the wo is ſeated and takes place, deſcribed by their office and man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of execution thereof.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Their office is deſcribed firſt in this title, ſcribes, or as Luke hath it, Lawyers, <hi>Luke</hi> 11. 46. ſignifying ſuch as produce and lay open the grounds and principles of that law, unto which they are ingaged and bound over unto of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice by, which in this place is the law of the carnal com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment, as in all the former woes is declared, which law ſtand, in oppoſition unto the law of Chriſt, <hi>Hebr.</hi> 7. 16.</p>
            <p n="2">2.

            <p>Therefore the fulfilling of the law conſiſts in one word love, <hi>Rom.</hi> 13. 8 9. <hi>Iames</hi> 2. 9. which is common to every Saint of God, as well as to any of them, and he that breaks one commandement is guilty of all, <hi>Iames</hi> 2. 10. which is proper to all wicked men of what rank ſoever, as well as to any one of them.</p>

The Phariſees interpretacions and prevarications of the Law in this point, is the very cauſe of moulding the word of God into Sermons, according to Inauguracions and Inſtalment of perſons into temporary and terrene Offices, Marriage Sermons, Faſting Sermons, Feaſting or Thankſgiving Sermons, Fune<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall Sermons, as though the word of God could be faithfully expounded and not involve the ſtate and condicion of all Saints, or all wicked men, what, where or whenſoever; men might as well affirm that ſomthing in the Son of God concerns ſome part of Gods elect, and not others; which is nothing elce but to divide Chriſt, and ſo make a nullity of him: this manner of interpretacion is a ſufficient and loud proclamacion of the Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſaicall Doctrin of this age, who cannot endure the Croſſe of Chriſt, as to bee ſtripped of all carnall power and glory, to bee dead in point of the Iewiſh Government and Prieſthood of the world, without which death he never ariſeth in the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er and glory of God, aſcending into the Throne of Gods right hand, where hee remaines conſecrated a Prieſt for evermore, <hi>Heb.</hi> 7. 28. and not elce where did he ever exerciſe his Office, nor never ſhall, for he is a Prieſt for ever after the Order of <hi>Melkizadek.</hi> Pſalm 110. 4. <hi>Hebr.</hi> 7. 3.</p>
            <p>The third point is, the manner of executing of their Office, ſignified in this term and title given unto them, namely, <hi>Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrites;</hi> wherein we may reminde our ſelves and recent what was noted before, the word ſignifying <hi>Stage-players,</hi> who coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terfeit and diſſemble things which are not, as themſelves to be perſons whom they are not, Times and Seaſons, Acts and Deeds recorded as though they were in preſent act of providence, which they know are not, but that they diſſemble the ſame in point of any preſent being of them.</p>
            <p>Thus theſe Hypocrites in expounding of the word of God, diſſemble the Fall of man as a thing that was and is not; the Concepcion, Birth, Life, Death, Reſurrection, and Aſcencion of Chriſt, as things paſt, and now are not, but only in Records and Hiſtories. Theſe Stage players do not only pick the purſes of their brethren, but pick out their eys in beholding vain Idols, not knowing the wiſdom and power of God that hath appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his Kingdom in Chriſt, to bee alike preſent, of like glory,

The firſt is their act, being twofould; and firſt they are ſaid to build the Tombs of the Prophets. Wee have heard before that a Tomb is a Monument or Memoriall of that which is not in preſent and reall being, and by <hi>Tomb</hi> in this place is meant the Hiſtoricall Narracions or Literall Form of the word of God as it utters it ſelfe in tearms comming within the capacities of the naturall and racionall conjectures of mans heart, or words which mans wiſdom teacheth, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2. 4.</p>
            <p>So that theſe men aſſume the word of God according to the literall form and verball expreſſions of the Prophets, and therby build and erect monuments of Conſtituted Churches, Offices therein, Governments, Orders, and painted Excellencies in the world, beginning and ending in Time, not compatible to the Son of God, thereby expelling the proper intent and minde of the Spirit, which is the ſoul or life of the Scriptures, and ſo ſet up a dead karkaſſe and liveleſſe memoriall, void of the life and ſpirit of our great and only Prophet, Ieſus Chriſt, <hi>Deut.</hi> 18. 15.</p>
            <p>For there is nothing wherein the heart of man expreſſeth it ſelfe by bringing forth ſom what wherein to employ himſelfe for a time in this world being temporary: But it is a grave where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in Chriſt is buried, if the angell or meſſenger of God roul not away the ſtone<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> or take away the difficulty, guard, props and defence thereof, <hi>and ſit upon it</hi> as an inferiour and ſubjected thing, <hi>Mat.</hi> 28. 2. making it the footſtool of his feet, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15. 24, 25. Yea the Ordinance of humane Marriages is a grave to bury Chriſt in, that he appear not in his eſpouſall, when the conjugall ty of the word of God is terminated there. For, it is in that point as it was at that Marriage in <hi>Canah</hi> of <hi>Galilee,</hi> performed according to the Iewiſh Rites, or the Dic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tates and naturall Ceremonies of mans heart; where Chriſt came to declare, that the proper power of the word of God con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſts not in ſuch things, no more than that water filling up thoſe ſix water<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>pots according to the purification of the Iewes, was like unto that wine which Chriſt commanded to be drawn out of the ſame; for when his mother (taken according to the fleſh) offered to terminate the buſineſſe of the day, wherefore Chriſt was bid thither in that temporary feaſt or marriage, tel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:40942:90"/>
him there wanted wine, to have his power and preſence to honour that, his anſwer is, <hi>woman what have I to do with thee? my hour is not yet,</hi> that is, my time and authority conſiſts not in theſe things.</p>
            <p>But when his mother who brought him forth, ſubmitted to his will, ſaying unto the ſervants, <hi>whatſoever hee commands, that do yee;</hi> then Chriſt commands thoſe weak and water-like Ordinances of the Iewes, or of the ſons of men, to bee drawn out, having the vigour and vertu of new and ſtrong wine, to admiracion, <hi>Iohn</hi> 2. 1. declaring thereby that tranſcendent power and glory that is in the time and preſence of Chriſt in all his Commands and Appointments, beyond all the Ordinances and Appointments of the ſons of men, the naturall Dictates of whoſe hearts lead them unto ſuch Orders in all temporary Inſtitucions as naturally as in that of Feaſtivity or Marriage; however the hypocriticall Phariſes ſolemnize them with the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent of the word of God.</p>
            <p>The Tomb of the Prophets erected in theſe things in the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parture of the ſoul and ſpirit, ſtands upon four pillars, which enervate the ſift and the ſixt Commandements.</p>
            <p n="1">1 Firſt, in point of Superiority.</p>
            <p n="2">2 Secondly, in point of Inferiority.</p>

            <p n="4">4 The fourth is our demeanour and carriage towards friends and enemies, in killing and preſerving life, which is the ſum of the ſixt Commandement.</p>
            <p>Firſt, in point of Superiority &amp; Rule, falſe interpreters cannot finde any viſible power upon the Earth but in Fathers, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the extent of the phraſe in the Commandement, which phraſe of <hi>Father</hi> and <hi>Mother</hi> include all exerciſe of Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. Neither can they utter any Glory of Submiſſion and Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience, but as <hi>Children</hi> are there to be extended, that is, to all wayes of yeeldings of obedience: and theſe they reſolve to be exerciſed between man and man, creature and creature, which is no better than a Tomb wherein the great Prophet is buried, yea the tru ſpirit of all the Prophets is thence departed, and the myſticall body of the Son of God corrupted by ſuch Doctrin.

For, the truth of relacion in point of Authority and Submiſſion, Command and Obedience, ſtands properly according to that reall intent of the word of God, in the relacion and reſpect that is between God and man in the faith and ſubſiſtance of Chriſt.</p>
            <p>Where the Spirit of God is the proper ſupply of the party in both reſpects, that is, in the exerciſe of obedience, as well as in the power of Command, and may as truly be found and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſed in one man as in twaine; or as in a multitude; For, ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periority is not worthy that name (bur in the ſence which the Apoſtle ſpeakes, when he ſaith, There are that be called gods, for there are gods many, and lords many) unleſſe it be ſuch a ſuperiority that hath power over the Angel, ſo as to prevail as a Prince with God, when as the Angel or <hi>Elohim,</hi> wept and made ſupplicacion, which is to be applied to the Angell, when he peticioned our father <hi>Jacob</hi> to let him go, <hi>Gen.</hi> 32. 24. &amp; 28. <hi>Hoſea.</hi> 12. 4. Such authority as hath power with God, is that which the Word of God intends, and in that ſence the Apoſtle ſaith, that the ſpirit of the Prophets is ſubject to the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14. 32. that is, when the Spirit of God in any of the ſervants of Chriſt do rightly interpret and unfold the Wiſdom of God in Chriſt, in the glory and power of it, the ſame Spirit of God, in all true interpreters of the Word of God, yeeld ſubmiſſion, and are obedient unto that wiſdom appearing in its power and glory, for this au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority hath rule in ſuch a ſpirit of obedience, as hath Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity in it, which is onely found in the Son of God, other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe it is not worthy the name of ſuperiority in the Language of Gods Kingdome, as it is ſaid, of the mercies of the wicked, that they are cruell, <hi>Pro.</hi> 12<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 10. So Rule Deſtitute of this is Cruelty.

Upon theſe two pillars of Rule and Subjecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, or Command and Obedience, do falſe Interpreters ſet the Tombes of the Prophets, falſifying the ſpirit of the Scriptures in ſtating them between man and man.</p>
            <p n="3">3 The thrid pillar is equality, lodging the Word of God in this point in men of like honour in the world, of like riches, of like age, of like office, trade, ocupation, art, learning, and the like, which is but a dumb ſhew, and lifeleſſe karkaſe of the Prophet, his ſpirit is departed and gone, it is not in ſuch miniſtration. For they know not how to equalize things in Chriſt, the true end of the Law, and ſo of all Relations: take this one inſtance for all, to ſhew their ignorance in this point of equality, they knew not how to make the ſtate of Chriſt, as in the wombe of the Virgin, to be of like power and glory, as ſet upon the Throne at the right hand of the power, <hi>Mat.</hi> 26. 64. for they know not what is taught unto us in that the Holy Ghoſt over ſhadowed the Virgin, namely, to ſhield the Conception of Chriſt, that no Rey or Glimſe of the Wiſdom, Will, Power, or any ſufficiency ariſing from the creature, ſhould contribute in the leaſt, to the being, or form of the Son of God in that holy and God like Conſiſtence of God and Man in one undivided ſtate, which is the Son of God, <hi>Luk,</hi> 1. 35. And in this Act the glory of the Son of God is made mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt, in that he is ſhadowed and ſhielded from all ſtaine or guilt of ſin, from all power and ſubtilty of Satan which are never ſeparated, yea from any evill or diſcommodious thing, touching Him which is as glorious a thing, and full of power in point of freedome, and releaſe, as his ſitting on the right hand of God in the exerciſe of all glory<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> grace &amp; vertue, which twain never were nor ſhall be ſeparated from the ſtate of Chriſt.</p>
            <p>And thus might we equalize all things in Chriſt, which ſeem to be unequall, unto carnall mindes, according to the
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:40942:91"/>
Letter, and Hiſtories of the Scriptures; which equality in Chriſt is that which the Scripture properly intends in all things, and when it ſpeakes of equality in point of friendſhip or brotherhood, it intends not a brotherhood compaſſed within any term or time, but an eternall off-ſpring, equall in all points, with reſpect to the right of the firſt born, and not as any one ſon being preferred before another; for there is but one intire ſon-ſhip of God, for wee are born of God, 1 <hi>Iohn</hi> 5. 1. 18. as being conceived by the Holy-ghoſt, <hi>Luke</hi> 1. 35. we alſo are begotten of God, for of his own will begat he us by the word of truth, <hi>Iames</hi> 1. 18. ſo that we are not only begotten of God, but alſo born of God: nothing but the wiſdom of God in that work of Chriſt, is in conjunction in the uttering and conceiving, in the forming of him and bringing of him forth as the firſt begotten, the firſt born, to be the firſt fruits of the Creacion, without which nothing is clean unto us. And this twofould parentage, as <hi>father</hi> and <hi>mother,</hi> uttered in the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement, are they or that which we honour as being the only off-ſpring of both made one in Chriſt; and hereby our dayes are prolonged in the Land which God hath given us; for herein conſiſts the length of dayes, even eternall Life, and are under the firſt Commandement with promiſe, for there was never Law before that, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 6. 1. 2. For God made the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe of Eternall Life before the world began, <hi>Titus</hi> 1. 2. ſo that the Saints are equall in being firſt born of immortall ſeed, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quall in poſſeſſing the firſt Land or inheritance, even the Land of <hi>Emanuel,</hi> that is, <hi>God with us, Mat.</hi> 1. 23. equall in being under the firſt Law, even the Law of the Spirit of life in Chriſt Ieſus, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 2. and equall in having the firſt promiſe annexed, for it was made unto us before the world began, <hi>Titus</hi> 1. 2.</p>
            <p>The true Equality then intended in the word of God, is to make all the Saints of God Kings and Prieſts of the ſame Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, Holineſſe, Power, and Authority, which is only of God; therefore a royall kingdom of Prieſts, and prieſt-hood kingly, a choſen generacion, not one more choyce than another; a pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar people, one not having leſſe or more intreſt in God than another; a purchaſed poſſeſſion, the ſame price payd for, and worth ſet upon one that is upon and for another, <hi>Exodus</hi> 19. 6.

            <p>And ſo much for the four Pillars upon which the Tombs of the Prophets are erected, and are every one of them a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat grave wherein Chriſt is buried, that he appears not in the world but in a ſenſuall reſpect.</p>
            <p n="1">1 For, the Superiority and Authority of the world is a grave wherein Chriſt as King is covered with that duſt or earth, and men walk over it and perceive it not, <hi>Luke</hi> 11. 44.</p>
            <p n="2">2 The Inferiority and temporary Subjection of the world is a grave wherein the High-prieſt of our profeſſion lies hid and covered, (mens eyes being directed unto that Monument) that they perceive not the Subjection of the Son of God <hi>who hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled himſelfe and became obedient unto death, even the death of the Croſſe,</hi> 1 <hi>Phil.</hi> 2. 8. <hi>Hebr.</hi> 3. 1.</p>
            <p n="3">3 The Doctrin of Equals in the world, is a Monument to cover Chriſt as he is the Firſt-born of God, when they ſtate Equals in King and King earthly, in Prieſt and Prieſt made by men, in Captain and Captain only for the ſlaughter, or preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vacion of an earthly body or corporacion; theſe things in E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quality being made the ſcope of their Doctrin, do fill the eys of men as a Monument ſet upon a grave, and ſo hide the ſtate of the firſt-bornſhip that is in Chriſt Ieſus, where every one hath equall Dignity; for every Saint and Son of God is the firſt, prime, and chief act of God; for, the tru form of Chriſt <hi>Gal.</hi> 4. 19. is the principall and chiefe work that ever God did, and all other things whatſoever are ſubſervient thereunto, <hi>Rom.</hi> 11. 36. <hi>P ov.</hi> 16. 4. No direct nor tru Equality can bee found therefore out of the Son of God, which is hid and buried by falſe interpretacions of the Word of God.</p>
            <p n="4">4 The fourth particular is a grave to bury Chriſt as he is the Captain of our Salvacion, <hi>Hebr.</hi> 2. 10. whilſt men ſet up a Hearſe of temporary Conqueſt over the bodies of men to be the end and accompliſhment of the word of God, for which their prayſe is to be returned, which hath not Eternity in it, for they dare not lay prayſes upon the Altar, for that they have thruſt mens ſouls down to Hell; therefore a temporary act that mens eyes muſt be held with as men beholding a Monu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment

upon a Grave, whilſt that within is hid and cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, even as the Captaine of our ſalvation is, by this do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, who is made perfect through ſuffering, and thereby ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains an eternal redemption, and not a temporary one, <hi>Heb.</hi> 9. 12. Therefore to centre the intent of the word of God in a tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porary deliverance by war, when there is a poſſibility to loſe it again, is a falſe interpretation of Scripture, a ſetting up of a Tomb, or Hearſe, like the Corps of the Prophet, the ſpirit, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per to the Prophet being utterly departed from all ſuch doctrine, as it ever was, and ever will be, to the corruption and putri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction of that body ſo framed, whether Kingdom, Prieſthood, equality of Elders and Senators, or valour in Conqueſt.</p>
            <p n="2">2 The ſecond point noted in this act, is their garniſhing of the Sepulchers of the Righteous, that is, of that Righteous, or juſt one Jeſus Chriſt, who is ſaid to be <hi>the Lord of our righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe, Ierem.</hi> 23. 6. As in the former point they order them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in way of worſhip to appear before God in an acceptable and orderly manner; ſo in this garniſhing of the Sepulchers of the righteous, they adorn themſelves as coming from God in the execution of juſtice, and performing the doom, as from him; ſo that the Tomb of the Prophet, and the Sepulcher of the Righteous teach, and inſtruct us in this, That whereſoever there is the exerciſe and entertainment of a falſe interpretation of the Word of God, there is ever a falſe and counterfeit procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding in all acts of juſtice; wherever the one is a Tomb to bury the true Prophet, the other is a Sepulcher to bury the Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous one, ſo that the proper ſpirit of the one, and of the other is vaniſhed, and appears not.</p>
            <p>For, a falſe miniſtry of the Word of God, exerciſing all pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence and diligence for the maintaining and upholding of the glory of man, and a cruel Magiſtracy or Government, exerciſing like prudence, power, and diligence, in the demoliſhing and pulling down the glory of God in Chriſt, are never ſeparated, 1 <hi>King.</hi> 19. 10. no more than the Spirit of true propheſie in the Son of God, and the Spirit of Righteouſneſſe and meekneſſe in the execution and fulfilment of the ſame, can ever be parted, in the way of Chriſt<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

But the men of the World know how to deck and adorn their cruelty, by which they keep the righteous one as buried in the Sepulcher; they know how to point and parget their actions ſo, as they ſhall appear glorious in the eyes of men, as a monument upon the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>epulcher, that the corruption and putrifaction con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted thereby ſhall not appear: and in the garniſhing of this Sepulcher there are four Ornaments of great uſe.</p>
            <p n="1">1.

            <p>And in like manner, men conclude that the ſtate of Satan cannot appear in men within the compaſſe of this life, becauſe they hold that humane abilities exerciſed according to hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane wiſdome, have ſome goodneſſe, or certain tincture, or glimpſe of holineſſe in them, therefore till that be extinct, the ſtate of the damned is not perfected, and ſo make both the bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing of God as alſo the curſe for ſome certain time to be lame and imperfect things, although ſuch offerings and tender of things have been abominable in the ſight of Almighty God, <hi>Lev.</hi> 22. 18. 22. <hi>Mal.</hi> 1. 8. 13-14.</p>
            <p n="2">2 The ſecond Ornament in the pargetting of this Sepulcher of the righteous, is gorgeous apparel, Crowns, Scepters, trap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pings of horſes, decking of Couches, Robes of Purple and Scar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>let, as m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

            <p n="3">3. The third Ornament upon this Sepulcher in the ſolemni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zation of the buriall of the juſt one, conſiſts of Chairs of State, Thrones, Seats of juſtice, erected by men, pulpits and upper Seats, which are not to be touched by other men, but reveren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced as the party to whom they belong, as things made vertuous by their alliance or relation unto them, <hi>Amos</hi> 7. 12. 13.

            <p n="4">4 The fourth Ornament in the decking of this Sepulcher, is their conſtituting of Laws proportionable to every fact, that ſo they may appear to have the wiſdom and equity of a deity in them; ſuch a law for the puniſhment of theft of ſuch a degree and nature, and another law for theft of another nature; this law for one degree of bribery and extortion, and ſuch a law for an other degree thereof; this law for one act of Idolatry, or Blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemy, and another law for another act and degree thereof; this for one kinde of Errour and Schiſme, and that for another; this puniſhment for one degree of Adultery, and that for another<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> all theſe are new and tranſitory laws made by man, and ſhall periſh with man, and therefore are changed according to the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious operations of the mind of man, coming within the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſe of ſuch things <hi>as periſb in the uſe, and are after the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandements and traditions of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

And the multiplyed and innumerable manifeſtation of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct laws and puniſhments for the breach of them, is to declare how unreckonable the wayes are, wherein that one holy mind and will of God in Chriſt may be contradicted and violated with the variety of plagues and puniſhments appertaining and an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexed thereunto: but every one of them of an infinite and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal nature, which cannot admit of any conteinment, limita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, or bounds of reſtraint, even as it is with one Son of God to have ſuch infinite wayes of the legal and orderly expreſſing of himſelfe, and to every one of them an eternal peace and ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction in God annexed.</p>
            <p>To terminate the word of God therefore in the diſtinctions of theſe humane laws and inſtitutions, together with their pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nalties or rewards annexed, is nothing elſe but to garniſh the burying place of that righteous and equal one, declaring to all the world that his ſpirit is ceaſed therein, and departed there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>from, ſo that all manner of diſſimulation and cruelty is to e expected in all the wayes of their adminiſtration, indevouring only to uphold the throne of iniquity by eſtabliſhing the wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome and glory of the fleſh, in the pulling down and demoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhing that righteous Reign and Scepter of the Son of God, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 94. 20. 23. <hi>Heb.</hi> 1. 8.

Compare <hi>Mat.</hi> 13. 3. with <hi>Mark.</hi> 4. 2. ſo that it is matter of doctrin whereby both

            <p n="1">1 And firſt they conclude their Progenitors to be Murthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers, in that they took away the lives of the Prophets, by which we ſee that it is a maxime written in all mens hearts, that the ceſſation of the ſpirit of prophefie, (which is done by falſifying and counterfeiting of the Scope and intent of the word of God) is a groſſe and capital ſin, which is to extort, and violently to take away the life of any one that is innocent.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Q.</hi> But if it be a ſin to take away by violence the life of the innocent, is it not a ſin to lay down, and part with an innocent life, if there be power to retain it? as Chriſt is ſaid to lay down his life, <hi>Iohn</hi> 10. 11, 12.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> The <hi>Anſwer</hi> to this is twofold; firſt, it is not againſt law to ſuffer as an innocent; for it is <hi>the gift of God to ſuffer, as well as to beleeve,</hi> Phil 1. 29. <hi>And it is a bleſſed thing to ſuffer for righteouſneſſe ſake,</hi> 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3. 14. but it is againſt law to take a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way the life of the innocent; for God never made law to take away the life of his Son, as the world do violently extort, and take it away; for then he ſhould inſtitute a law againſt himſelf, and that eternal life; for the Father and the Son are one, <hi>Iohn</hi> 10. 30<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly, we anſwer, that Chriſt layes down his life properly with reſpect unto his death unto all the motions of ſin &amp; opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the fleſh in all things, which is his proper quickning and reviving in the ſpirit, and living eternally unto God, which death i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

            <p n="2">2 The ſecond point in the order of the text ſtands in what they ſay in way of excuſing and clearing of themſelves, in theſe words; <hi>if we had been in the dayes of our Fathers, we would not have taken parts with them in the blood of the Prophets,</hi> wherein they acknowledge their Fathers to be murtherers, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

            <p>This is the doctrine of all falſe and hypocritical Interpreters at this day, who ſay, that Satan is in a worſe condition than man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, though never ſo wicked, becauſe the Devil ſinned volunta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily without a tempter, but man ſinned being tempted &amp; drawn aſide by another, plainly declaring thereby, that they know not what the Devil is, (who is ſo often in their mouths and hearts alſo) nor what mans fall from God is, nor wherein conſiſts that great, though ſecret inlet of ſin into the world.</p>

            <p>Again, they teach that in the way of God there is a better, and an inferiour condition, as that one ſon of God is nearer to the father, and in greater favour and dignity than another, whereas they reall firſt-born, <hi>Heb.</hi> 12. 23. or elſe they cannot be an acceptable gift, nor are they to be conſecrated unto the Lord, unleſſe they be the opening, or <hi>emiſſion of the womb, Exod.</hi> 13. 1<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 2. <hi>Luk.</hi> 1. 13. therfore they are called in Hebrew <hi>Coach,</hi> the firſt of Gods might, or able ſtrength, or the <hi>beginning ofſtrengths;</hi> ſo the firſt-born is named, <hi>Deut.</hi> 21. 17. <hi>Gen.</hi> 49. which Chriſt complains <hi>to be dryed up,</hi> perſonating himſelfe in thoſe wicked Iews his perſecutors, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 22. 15.

Oh Serpents, that feed on nothing but baſeneſſe by the verdict of God, for to caſt the word of God into a tranſitory form, is nothing elſe but that unclean Spirit of the Devil, which Chriſt here, (as his manner is) rebukes: for though there be an acknowledgement of Chriſt <hi>to be the Son of the moſt high God,</hi> yet in that they profeſſe Chriſt to be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother thing than themſelves are, for they are affraid of being tormented by him, therefore reckon themſelves to be another thing: for Chriſt doth not torment himſelfe, <hi>no man hates his own fleſh, Epheſ.</hi> 5. 19.

So falſe interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters they take out the letter and hiſtory of the word from the

intent and mind of God, and by that means bruiſe and ſqueeze out the life and ſpirit of Scripture, that not a print of Chriſts proper footſteps which he hath truly taken therein can appear, being they have carnallized them, by cloſing up the fleſh inſtead therof, as though the glory &amp; power conſiſted only therein, and as though no defect were upon man in the departure of the rib or bone, the life and ſpirit of the word, wherein all true power and glory doth conſiſt; which they by this means of ſpoyling the proper print of Chriſts footſtep, which he hath ſet upon all things in heaven and in earth, terminating the form thereof in tranſient things, which is the arm of fleſh, and ſo with the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent are accurſed, <hi>Jerem.</hi> 17. 5.

And that this Sepent ſets upon his own principles, which are carnall and dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bolicall, which principles by that means, he covertly and cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ningly inſinuates into the world, by transforming himſelf into an Angel of light, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11. 13. for the upholding of the glory, power, riches, and outward proſperity thereof, as though the way of Ieſus Chriſt were promoted and propagated therein.

            <p>Again, another term or title given unto them, is, he cals them the generation of Vipers, there is a brood and off-ſpring of them as proceeding from the Viper, a Serpent differing from the former in the bringing forth of its ſeed, being moſt poyſonfull and venemous; it is ſaid that ſome of that kind biting a man, that if preſent and ſoveraign remedy be not applyed, he dyeth within the compaſſe of three hours; theſe breed not of eggs, as <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

Right ſo it is with theſe falſe interpreters, they breed not but in the womb of that Harlot who adulterates the word of God, by making the copulations thereof to conſiſt in earthly relations and things, and the very breeding and bringing
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:40942:104"/>
forth of ſuch a brood and generation is the deſtruction of that ſtate and condition in which they are bred; for the divinations and witchcrafts of the Devil do not only bewitch, but it is alſo bewitched; it doth not only deſtroy, but it is deſtroyed, therfore ſaith Chriſt of this Spirit<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> or Serpent, Oh generation of Vipers, who hath bewitched you, forewarned or foreſtalled your hearts, as to think that baptiſms, bodily exerciſes, verball expreſſions, and temporary inſtitutions ſhould be armour of proof upon you to eſcape the wrath to come, being it is as truly to come as it hath been from the beginning? therefore a temporary act or inſtitution cannot defend, nor ſhelter from it.</p>
            <p>Yea, to deſtroy, and to be deſtroyed, to bewitch, and to be bewitched, are as really in the wicked, as to ſave, and to be ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> to heal, and to be healed are in the Son of God. So that whilſt men are deſtroying ſilly women for witchcraft, laden with iniquity, it is well if they be not deſtroying themſelves; for there are ſelf deſtroyers which do not appear to all men, when the ſpirit whereby they are held puts them upon defigns to purſue with great eagerneſſe, which becomes often, not only the deſtruction of their ſouls, but their bodies alſo in fine therof.</p>
            <p>Againe, it is ſaid of the poyſonful Viper, that the poyſon thereof retains its vertue, after the Serpent is dead, which is not found to be in other Serpents; So in falſe Interpreters, be they never ſo dull, incapable, naturally civil, ſeeming to be dead in regard of doing any hurt, let them but be dead unto the ſpirit and life of the Scriptures, they are as poyſonfull and deadly in their wayes in the ſight of God, as ſuch as are moſt quick, lively and active in the ſight and judgement of men.</p>
            <p n="2">2 From which he brings the ſecond point propounded in the Text, how ſhould you eſcape the damnation of Hell? In this interrogation he challengeth them, if they can find out any way or means of eſcape, any time or place of eſcape, any hopes or ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation of a poſſibility of eſcape, and ſo is a ſtrong affirmation, that they never can, nor ſhall; in like ſence Chriſt interrogates, <hi>How can you beleeve and receive honour one of another, and ſeek not the honour that cometh from God only, Iohn</hi> 5. 44? that is, you can never believe, repoſe truſt and confidence in the power
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:40942:104"/>
of God alone, when ye prefer another honour than that which is only of God; ye cannot have unity with God, when you joy n another glory together with God, for he is of ſuch nature, that is, either all in all, or elſe becomes vain in that party, where he is not ſo in all things; this interrogation therefore concludes and ſtrongly affirms by arguing it upon the conſcience of the Serpent, together with all his off-ſpring as the brood of a Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, that they can never eſcape or be releaſed from the damnati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Hell.</p>
            <p>By damnation in this place is meant a juſt and final Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence, together with the ſevere execution thereof, to an ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting and utter deſtruction, <hi>Mark</hi> 3. 29. And by Hell in this place is meant the proper ſtate of the Devil himſelfe, even as by Heaven the Scriptures intend God himſelfe, or the Son of God; therefore where one Evangeliſt ſaith, the Kingdom of Heaven, another expreſſing the ſame thing ſaith the Kingdome of God, <hi>Mat.</hi> 19. 23. compared with <hi>Mark</hi> 10. 23. So the Prophet <hi>Daniel</hi> in the interpretation of <hi>Nebuchadnezzars</hi> dreames, Firſt he cals God by the name of the moſt high; and ſecondly by the name of Heaven; ſaying, <hi>Thou ſhalt know the Heavens rule,</hi> or thou ſhalt know the Heaven rules, <hi>Dan.</hi> 4. 25. 26. the phraſe plural may be indifferently taken; even ſo in this place, by Hell we are to underſtand the Devil. The force of the argument ſtands thus, you have that ſpirit of the Serpent, by which the curſe entered upon mankind, therefore you are juſtly called Serpents, you are that generation and off<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>ſpring of the poyſonfull Viper, or ſeed of the Serpent, you have the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, diſpoſition and operation of the Serpent who brought in the curſe, and propagates it in the world untill now, which is nothing elſe but the Devil; therefore you being the Serpent, the Viper, the generation, the original and off ſpring of the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil, how can it be poſſible that you ſhould eſcape the proper ſtate and condition, the condemnation and deſtruction of him whom you are; for the Devil is that falſe interpreter of the word of God from the beginning, for he is a Lyer from the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. <hi>Iohn</hi> 8. 44.

And if the evils we bring in be ſuch as concern us, and not the ſon of God, then we take them up upon our ſelves, as we being the ſaviours and deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verers of our ſelves, being out of that proper ſtate and conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the ſon of God, and ſo deny the death of the ſon of God to be that which it is; namely, to comprehend and comprize a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

            <p>And thus falſe Interpreters bring in a Tree of the knowledg of good and evill, to be communicated with, in the perfecting of the word and work of God which is the way of the Serpent in his ſeed at this day, which ever kils and murders the true Prophet in not ſuffering the life and Spirit of the word of God to come forth and appear, which life is ever taken away by them, to raiſe up, advance, and maintain the life of the fleſh, in all the luſts, pride, glory, power, and abominations thereof, according to their preſent ſtate, as they can ſtand with the rank and ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion wherein they are ſet, or ſerve in way of further preferment.

               <hi>I ſend unto you,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>Prophets,</hi> &amp;c. the perſons to whom he ſpeaks here, are falſe Interpreters, who judge falſely of the word and work of God, whether in themſelves, teaching and decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring it to others; or approving it from others, it matters not, it is alike deteſtable in all; the Serpent divulging, and the wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man approving, is all one in this point; and to parties of this rank
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:40942:107"/>
and quality, the ſon of God utters theſe words, <hi>Behold I ſend unto yon Prophets, Wiſe men, and Scribes,</hi> which are all taken in a good ſenſe, as good and holy men (in this place) ſent from the Lord our righteouſneſſe; from whence this queſtion may be moved; namely, how the word of God by good men, yea, by the Son of God himſelfe may be ſaid to be ſent to wicked men, yea to falſe Interpreters thereof, which ſpirit of falſhood is never found but in the Devil himſelfe.</p>
            <p n="1">1 This point narrowly ſcanned, may breed ſome commotion in the mind of man; for if God ſend his word unto the wicked, which hath ſalvation in it, then if he deal plainly with them (whoſe nature it is ſo to do) his intent is to do them good ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by, and to ſave them; and if ſo, then ſalvation depends upon the will of the Creature, in the approving or diſallowing, in its reception or rejection thereof.</p>
            <p n="2">2 Again, if God do not intend their ſalvation, that is, of theſe wicked Scribes and Phariſees unto whom he ſends it, then he may ſeem to pretend one thing in ſending it unto them, and to intend an other, which is deceit, and therefore he being a God of truth, which cannot lie or feign a thing to be which is not, it may ſeem that he ſends his word only unto the elect of God, which is contrary unto this expreſſion of Chriſt; but the ſon of God being one, is at unity in all his enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſes.</p>
            <p n="3">3 Furthermore the waters may ſeem to be troubled in this point, in regard that the word of God was never ſincerely ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed, as the word of God ſent from him, but by one who is of the faith of Ieſus, made one with God by vert<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>e of that co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant of grace in Chriſt; for in other way, the Lord never ſent, nor uttered himſelf in his own language, and upon his own proper terms, for otherwayes it is not the word of God, but the word of man, which is naught, and brings to naught.</p>
            <p>Therefore if the word of God be ſent by a Prophet, a Wiſe man, or Scribe, men that are godly and holy, as the word is ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, being one with it; for the word of Chriſt never appeared, nor uttered it ſelf, but in and by the ſpirit of man, for if it come not from him in whom God and man conſiſt in one, it is not
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:40942:108"/>
the word of Chriſt; how then can it be ſent to all wicked men ſeeing as many men live and dye, and a godly man never cometh nigh unto them; yea it may be as is like, people and nations; if we look but upon the <hi>Moores, Indians,</hi> and <hi>Barbarians</hi> in theſe our dayes; doubtleſſe it is and hath been the caſe of many thouſand men in the world, never to hear a Prophet, and holy man of God ſpeak, although Scribes and Phariſees may ſpeak plentifully for their own advantage, as alſo many Infants dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing before they have the uſe of reaſon; a godly man therefore can never be ſent or expeſſe himſelfe unto them.</p>
            <p n="4">4 Add further, the voice of Satan never uttered it ſelf, but as man was really conſidered therein: ſo it was in <hi>Cain,</hi> in whom Satan is ſaid to be a murtherer from the beginning, and ſo he is in all who wander in that way of <hi>Cain</hi> unto this day: how comes it to paſſe then that Satan is ſaid to tempt the Saints when no wicked man is found near, nor ſeems to know there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of? for the heart of man is deceitfull above meaſure, who can know it, ſave only the Lord who ſearcheth the ſame? <hi>Ier.</hi> 17. 9, 10.

            <p>Now the word of God is the will of God, and the will of God is the law of God, as the word ſignifies, where it is ſaid,

            <p>The ſubtle Philoſophers of this age, who cunningly work in that art of the Magicians, or Wiſe men of <hi>Egypt,</hi> in going a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout to deſcribe God by the delineation of ſeveral names and at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributes, in a ſimple divine eſſence or being, without reſpect un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to, or any union had, with mankind; theſe are pure and abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute Atheiſts and denyers of God, in that they preſcribe a ſta e of divine being, wherein the ſon of God, as Ieſus Chriſt, is nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther reckonable, nor of any uſe; this is as abſolute and abomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable Atheiſme<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as to conclude that the Creature, that is, the whole viſible Creation, did produce it ſelfe, and give it ſelf form and motion, without the Almighty power of an infinite and eternal God, for to deſcribe or bring to light the Creator in any thing without reſpect unto the Creature, is all one as to deſcribe and bring forth the Creature without reſpect unto a Creator,

and how abominable that is let all men judge, the one is the doctrine of the Prieſthood of the world in their catechizing, or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thodox, evangelized divinity, and the other is, the doctrine of the Sooth-ſayers and Star-gazers, in their Aſtrological and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phetical fictions, both of them alike deceiving the world in all ages thereof, <hi>Iſaiah</hi> 47 13. 14. 15. <hi>Dan.</hi> 1. 20. <hi>Dan.</hi> 2. 27. 28.</p>
            <p n="2">2 A ſecond concluſion for the anſwer of the queſtion pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded is, that the word of God never uttered it ſelfe, but as it layes it ſelfe in a twofold fountain: for it could never utter it ſelf, in that ſimple and ſingle boſom of eternity, for ſo there were not any thing to utter it ſelfe unto, and then there can be no publication thereof, and therefore muſt be founded in a creature to ſpring up from thence: therefore the Pſalmiſt affirms, that <hi>out of the mouths of babes and ſucklings thou haſt founded ſtrength, Pſalm</hi> 8. 2. that is, thou haſt not only eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed and grounded all thy praiſes, there, but thou haſt fitted and made them moſt perfect in that way, as the greeke word <hi>Katerti<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>o</hi> ſignifies, which the Apoſtle uſeth, <hi>Mat.</hi> 21. 16.</p>
            <p>A like phraſe is uſed concerning the enemies of Chriſt, they ſet themſelves, and take counſell together, that is, (as the words there import) they have laid their plot and foundation, as perſons united to accompliſh their deſigns, <hi>Pſalm</hi> 2. 2. ſo God hath laid the platform and foundation of the manifeſtation of himſelfe in all his wayes and works whatſoever in Chriſt, the weaklings of the world who have no helpe of man at all, that they can any way depend upon, <hi>Pſalm</hi> 146. 3. 4. <hi>Pſalm</hi> 60. 11.</p>
            <p>So that the word of God is laid and founded in the Creature, as truly as in the Creator, to ſpring up and utter it ſelf from the unity of them both, or elſe how came the Creature to exiſt, if the word of God did not ſpring up in it and utter it ſelfe thereby? only obſerve this, that as man was the laſt in the Creation, as the end and ſcope of all, who only was made in the image of God, even ſo the proper drift and ſcope of the word of God in a l the reſt of Gods works runs properly unto mankind as being that Maſterpeece of all Gods works, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:40942:109"/>
the word of God only terminates it ſelf, and not elſewhere, as in any other Creature whatſoever in Heaven or Earth: for all the reſt of the Creatures are but as the hand in the Dyal, or ſound of the Clock, which proclame and point at time, which they themſelves are not, but may give true or falſe intelligence according to the skill of him who hath the ordering of them: even ſo all the reſt of the Creatures they point at, and poclame Chriſt, as another thing, than any, or all of themſelves are, and may give true or falſe intelligence according to the wiſdom or folly of that ſpirit by which they are managed, even as the word of God doth by true or falſe interpretation thereof, in the heart or mouth of him who hath the management of the ſame.</p>
            <p n="3">3 Thirdly, conſider that the word of God terminated in the Creator, and in the Creature, there is to be conſidered in the height and perfection of the one, and of the other, a diſtinct wiſdom, that is to ſay, a wiſdom peculiar to God, with reſpect unto the Creature, and a wiſdom proper unto man with reſpect unto God, by vertue whereof the ſame thing is formed and uttered in the wiſdom of the Creature, that is, in the wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom and knowledge peculiar to God, and therefore all things in the beginning are ſaid to be good, that is, acceptable and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſirable unto man, as well as approvable unto God, ſo that there is nothing in the viſible Creation that man can reject, or deſire to have annihilated, and not to be, if he knew but the nature, end and uſe thereof, with reſpect to himſelfe; therefore all things are ſaid to be good, both in mans account, and in the account of God, ſo that whatſoever man called the Creature, ſo its name was concluded to be by the Creator, <hi>Gen.</hi> 2. 19. 20.

            <p n="4">4 In the fourth place we conclude, that the word of God utters it ſelfe from divers principles, for according to the mind and wiſdom of God in Chriſt, it utters it ſelf from eternall and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>changeable principles.</p>

But the wiſdome humane utters it ſelf upon principles mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentany and tranſient, as now man is clothed with the righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſſe of the Son of God by faith in Chriſt, but in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning man ſtood juſt before God, in a certaine innocency, which was not that righteouſneſſe of the ſon of God, Ieſus Chriſt, therefore tranſient, it is paſt away; for the righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of God is ſufficient for the Saints, and then all other is ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfluous; neither was there ever any other but ſuch as is coy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by the Phariſee; ſo alſo it ſaith now the Saints are in light, but there was a time when they were in darkneſs; now they are converted and alive unto God, but <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>here was a time when they were dead in that reſpect; now they are under ſin, but at ſuch a time there was no ſin, that is, in the time of that falſe and counterfeited innocency; now the Saints are remote from Chriſt but a time will come when they ſhall be near him<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> now they have faith &amp; hope, but then they ſhall have need of neither.</p>
            <p>Yea, they make Chriſt a momentany and tranſient thing, ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, that now he is one with mans nature, but the time was when he was not one with it, nor had any uſe thereof; as alſo they affi m that now he is alive in the ſame ſence, wherin he was ſaid to be dead, according to the proper intent of the word of God, which makes him a tranſient and changeable ſon, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time a live, and ſometime dead in the ſame reſpect in the intent of Scripture</p>
            <p>Yea theſe men make God himſelfe according to their Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophical deſcription of him, to be a tranſient and changeable God, for they teach that he was once well pleaſed with man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind univerſally without any exception, but in the fall he was diſpleaſed with them, which is to make a change in the All<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty and that now he is offended and diſpleaſed with his Saints on earth in many things, till repentance hath wrought peace again, but the time will come when he will be well plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed with them in all things; yea, and that he was once well pleaſed with the Divell<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but now he is at enmity with him, which enmity againſt Satan therefore cannot be eternal, and ſo there is a diſlike or diſowning in God which is not eternal, God then is not like himſelf, nor ſuitable to his own nature; therefore by the doctrine ſpringing out of theſe humane principles, for it
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:40942:111"/>
makes God momentany and tranſient, and in ſuch principles conſiſts the ſpirit of that old Serpent the Devil and Satan from the beginning untill now, and the more ſtudiouſly men exerciſe their thoughts upon ſuch grounds and principles, the further they wander out of the way, and ſtray from God, in the ſight of all good men, making it clear and manifeſt unto whom they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long, and of what brood and off-ſpring they are.</p>
            <p n="5">5 The fifth concluſion is, that the word of God is of like con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernment in all men, and takes hold of them with like force, whether it be laid in the way of the bleſſing or of the curſe; for it is of like concernment to maintain and uphold the principles of the Creature, that it is to maintain and uphold the principles peculiar to God; for if the principles of the Creature were not upheld to their height, which argue themſelves into the place, office, and ſeat of God, 2 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 2. 3. 4. then there were no place for the curſe, and then the redemption of Chriſt were without vertue, in that it delivered from no wretched nor cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed condition, and then praiſe-worthineſſe due unto God ſhould ceaſe, having no matter, nor cauſe from which to take place.</p>
            <p>Again, if mans principles were not maintained, as well as the principles peculiar to God, the word and work of God ſhould faile and be extinct; for the word of God never uttered it ſelf, nor did the work of God exiſt, but in order to Gods wiſdom framing the Son of man into its own likeneſſe, making him in conformity with it ſelfe, which is the ſtate of the Son of God Ieſus Chriſt, as alſo the wiſdom of man framing the Son of God into its own ſimilitude and likeneſſe, conforming him into the proportion of naturall and earthly principles, which is the ſtate of Antichriſt, that ſon of perdition, and if ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of theſe ſhould fail, the word and work of God ſhould faile, which are as durable as God himſelf, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119. 89. 90.</p>
            <p>The word of God therefore takes hold of all men, yea of whole mankind with like authority and force, both in way of the curſe, as alſo in the way of bleſſedneſſe, for each maintains its own proper principles as upon life and death; for in caſe mans principles and reaſonings ſhould take place, and beare ſway in a Saint, the life and ſpirit of God ſhould be extinct, and
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:40942:111"/>
if the wiſdom and argument of the Son of God ſhould take place and bear ſway in any wicked man, then the ſpirit of Satan whereby he lives would be extinct, ſo that each of them hath the fo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ce and authority of life and death upon them, than the which a greater bond cannot be; for if the force and authority of the word of God were not of like power in point of wrath in the way of the curſe, as to hold proportion with the word of bleſſing and peace, then could not the word of God hold proportion with it ſelfe, which muſt of neceſſity be in all things, of an infinite and illimited force and au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority.</p>
            <p n="6">6 In the ſixth place we conclude, that the word of God hath ordained &amp; neceſſitated it ſelf to come unto all men in way of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretation, and that in all its expreſſions and intimations what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever, becauſe it ſpeaks and utters it ſelf in mankind from divers principles, and therefore the word muſt be interpreted or tranſlated <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ut of one into another, that is, out of one proper ſpeech or language into another, and the very formings and faſhionings of the heart is the proper ſpeech or language of man, therefore the abundance of the heart is that which he ſpeaks, <hi>Mat.</hi> 12 34 Now God hath taken up all things of man as he hath reſpect to all Creatures, to utter and reveal his ſecret wiſdom and counſel by in Chriſt, the ſpirit of God therefore in the Saints, takes out the minde and meaning of God from that originall Copy naturally written in the Tables of ſtone, in all mens hearts, and tranſlates it according to that wiſdom of God in Chriſt, into the fleſhy Tables of the heart, fitted to receive the impreſſions of God, by the removal of thoſe ſtony, ſtrong and earthly apprehenſions and concluſions which man na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally conceivs and concludes within himſelfe from the word of God; ſo that Gods true intent according to the dictate of his ſpirit being taken out of that husk or ſhell, wherein it is expreſſed, is no more the language of the fleſh, but of the ſpirit, and this is of neceſſity to be done in the conſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of the Spirit and life of Ieſus Chriſt, the Son of God.</p>
            <p>Again, the ſpirit of errour and falſe interpretation takes out of that originall copy of the wiſdom of G d that law of
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:40942:112"/>
the ſpirit of life in Chriſt, and tranſlates it into principles and concluſions humane, proper to the thoughts, device and inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of a Creature, terminating the mind and will of God in things limited by time, place and perſon, things tranſitory, which cannot hold proportion with the Son of God, and by means of this tranſlation<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> it is no more the language of the ſpirit, but the language of the fleſh, and ſo the dictates of the Serpent, the mind and will of Satan, who captivates man by the luſts of his own heart, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2. 26.</p>
            <p>Furthermore, the word of God is not the word of life with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out interpretation, as it is tranſlated out of death into life, ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he ſaith, <hi>Thou wilt not leave my ſoul in Hell, neither wilt thou ſuffer thy holy one to ſee Corruption, Pſalm.</hi> 16. 10. Neither is the ſpirit of God, a ſpirit of Revelation, nor hath the honour of opening the mind of the father, in any, without this grace of interpretation, whereby man is conformed unto the i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage and ſimilitude of the Son of God.</p>
            <p>Add further, that man cannot lay claime to his proper being and prerogative (as he is wicked) namely, to be wiſer than the beaſts of the field, or to have dominion over the inferiour Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, but as he tranſlates the excellencies of God into his own humane principles, and thereby exalts himſelf as Lord over all the works of Gods hand, and by this his tranſlation he inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prets the word of God in direct oppoſition unto Gods true in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent, and proper meaning, in that originall Copy of Gods wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome in Chriſt preſented unto the world, and hereby are the principles of humane wiſdom ſet up to bear ſway in the world, in the vilifying of the wiſdom of God in Chriſt, by which means the life of Satan is continued in the ſons of mortall men.</p>
            <p>And this interpretation is by tranſlating one tongue and language into another, which cannot be done but by preſenting the originall Copy which by this means is caſt aſide and vili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, as to be no more imbraced nor accepted, and in this preſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of the original Copy of the wiſdom of God, which can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not but be acknowledged by all men, ought to be magnified, and ſubmitted unto by all, doth the anſwer of the queſtion pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded conſiſt; for in this repreſentation of the wiſdom of
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:40942:112"/>
God unto mankinde, contained in ſuch, yea the ſame expreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons written upon every mans heart herein, doth the ſpirit of the Prophet, the Wiſe-men and Scribes viſit all the wicked of the world; yea there where never good man bodily appeared a d in their rejection of the wiſdom of God, and imbracing the wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of the fleſh, they kill the ſpirit of the Prophets, perſecute and evilly intreat them, to their own deſtruction, and finall o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verthrow.</p>
            <p>So that the word of God in way of the curſe, as it utters it ſelfe in the principles proper to a creature, cannot take account of it ſelfe in the conſervation of thoſe principles and aptitudes, but as it terminates the mind of the ſpirit of God in them which is an utter ceſſation of the proper language of the Son of God, and killing of the ſpirit of the Prophets, of which ſpirit and ſtate of the Son of God there is not one Prophet, wiſe man, or Scribe in Gods eſteem and account ſuffered to live in the world; for the ſon of God reckons and accounts of himſelfe, only according to that wiſdom, which eternizeth all things in his eſtate and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition; for though the Son of God be a Creature, as well as a Creator, yet his eſtate, through that unity of both, is an eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall eſtate and condition, ſo that the ſpirit of the word of God, is ſent unto, and preſents it ſelf to all men whatſoever, in the very ſame things themſelves ſpeak<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as that the moſt Excellent is to have the preheminence, who is the Author of all things, and the end of them alſo; and if this be but granted, which no man can deny (for <hi>Pharaoh</hi> in his ſober mood will acknowledg Gods preheminency) of what worth, or of what excellent uſe then ſhall any temporary thing be accounted, or appear to be, if God have preheminence in wiſdom, power, authority, riches, peace, plenty, friendſhip, and the like; every thing in him is full and compleat in whomſoever he communicates the ſame, where then is there a vacuum found for, or a neceſſary uſe of, the glory, wiſdom, power, authority, friendſhip, riches and proſperity of the world, to make the Saints of God more honourable proſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous or excellent, than that wherein their proper being doth conſiſt, which the world cannot give, neither can they take it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way, nor work a diminution thereof in the leaſt.</p>
            <p>Note hence, that in regard the glory of the Creature is of
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:40942:113"/>
no uſe, but altogether blaſted and withered as graſſe, whereſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever the ſpirit of God breaths as a North wind, and as the South wind upon the garden of God, that the Spices thereof may flow out, when the beloved comes to eat his pleaſant fruit, <hi>Iſaia</hi> 40. 6. 7. 8. <hi>Iames</hi> 1. 10. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 24. <hi>Cant.</hi> 4. 16. Therefore it is, that the wiſdom of the Creature, to exalt fleſh, in preferring it before the life and ſpirit of the Lord Ieſus (who lives for ever) terminates the word of God in carnal and terrene things, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to its own principles, whereby it preſerves a carnal and ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſual life in its ſelfe, contradictory to the life and ſpirit of the ſon of God, and the ſpirit and life of all true propheſie or found in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretation of the word of God, and ſo quencheth the ſpirit, and deſpiſeth propheſie, 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 5. 19. 20. purſuing carnal do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine and bodily exerciſes upon the life and death of his ſpirit, being engaged and bound over thereunto by the carnall Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement, Cuſtoms and Traditions of men, and thereby ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pungeth and evacuateth the life and ſpirit of the Scripture, which is the life and ſpirit of the ſon of God, who is the only Prophet of the Church ſingularly conſidered, and all the Prophets of the Church, in a true and real diſtribution, and plural accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, according to the minde of the Scriptures, <hi>Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles</hi> 1. 3.</p>
            <p>We conclude then in order to the queſtion, that no man can carnalize the word of God, out of the Characters written in his own heart, <hi>Rom.</hi> 2. 13. 14. 15. 16. (in which expreſſions, the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit is involved) but his heart is touched with a higher thing than himſelfe can form in his preſent act, therefore Chriſt is ſtill to come, or hath been here, but is departed in the judgment or doctrine of a carnall Iew or Gentile, and takes not a perfect and real form in any thing they do or ſay; but ſomething is of a higher nature which theſe ſteps are aſcending unto: ſhall we think that men conſtituting a Church of a company of people who were no ſuch thing the other day, and in a few years fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing it ſhall come to nothing, are not touched with ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of a higher, more excellent, eminent and durable nature, which this is only a help or ſtep to attain unto; ſhall we think that men exerciſed in ordaining officers, for their defence, ſafe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, honour, and inſtruction, are not touched with higher things
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:40942:113"/>
which theſe lead unto; ſhall men be exerciſed in bread and wine and water, chewed with the teeth, taken into the natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall ſtomack, waſhing and dipping the naturall body, which food periſheth, which water ſlideth away; are not theſe men tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched with matters of higher concernment then any of theſe things are, or ever can be?</p>
            <p>Theſe touches and intimations therefore are the viſitations of the ſpirit of the true Prophet, ſent unto theſe wicked, hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>critical and diſſembling Scribes and Phariſees, the blind guides of the world, whoſe vilification of the ſpirit in preferring car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall Rites and Ordinances, is the rejection, perſecution, and kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of the ſpirit of the true Prophet, maintaining nothing but a dead carkaſſe of Religion, or dead bulk or body of the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures in the world, for their own gaine, honour, cruelty, and contriving of means, and making of engines and inſtruments to exerciſe their enmity upon the ſpirit of true propheſie and inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretation, in the perſon of whomſoever it appears in the world, and herein conſiſts the very root and riſe, the ſeed and off-ſpring of the Serpent, which is the Devil and Satan in his operations in the men of the world as at this day.</p>
            <p>Obſerve further in this point, that the word of God as it ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters it ſelfe, according to Gods wiſdom upon principles proper to the eternall Son of God, cannot take an account of it ſelfe in the conſervation and maintaining of them, nor can it ſpeak its own proper language, but as the originall copy out of which it is tranſlated preſents it ſelfe, which is the letter of the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, the characters written upon mans heart, the very engine and inſtrument of Satan, whereby he exalts himſelfe; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon the ſpirit of revelation is neceſſitated unto interpretation, taking out the mind of God in rejection of the will and wiles of Satan, and ſo becomes an interpreter one of a thouſand, to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare unto man his righteouſueſſe to be ſuch, as becomes the only begotten Son of God, <hi>Iob</hi> 33. 23. 24. tranſlating the lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage of the Creature, into the proper wiſdom and ſpeech of the Son of God, in whom the proper language which man natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally ſpeakes, with reſpect to the word of God hath no place, nor do humane principles bear any ſway in him at all; therefore when the Mother of Chriſt, according to the fleſh would have
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:40942:114"/>
had his glory to have appeared at the marriage feaſt (in <hi>Canaan</hi> of <hi>Gallilee)</hi> to the end, to lift up ſuch relations, he ſaith, <hi>Woman what have I to do with thee, my hour is not yet, Iohn</hi> 2. 1. 2. 3. 4. that is, my glory conſiſts not in any of theſe things, nor never ſhall; therefore cals her woman, as not acknowledging naturall relations, as coming within the account of his proper time and oration.</p>
            <p>Humane principles therefore in the intent and extent proper unto them, have no place in Chriſt no more than the Devill himſelfe hath, who hath no part in him, <hi>Iohn</hi> 14. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

            <p>The next point noted in the Text is the party ſending theſe Miniſters and Meſſengers, and that is Chriſt; <hi>Behold I ſend unto you, Prophets, Wiſe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>men and Scribes,</hi> in which words Chriſt ſecretly inſinuates his own proper ſtate and condition, manifeſting his wiſdome and skill, in that he tranſlates the ſpeeches and practice of theſe wicked and deceitfull Interpreters into a ſpirituall and heavenly reſpect and relation in himſelfe, that as they relate themſelves unto their fathers, who they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe to be Murtherers, and ſo bring guilt upon themſelves, as they are their off-ſpring; ſo Chriſt relates himſelfe unto God that heavenly father, and makes himſelfe one with him, as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears by the conferrance of the Evangeliſts, for <hi>Luke</hi> hath it thus; <hi>Therefore ſaid the wiſdome of God, I will ſend them Prophets and Apoſtles, Luke</hi> 11. 49. or as the word will bear, the wiſdom of God <hi>ſaith,</hi> in the preſent tenſe, as being a preſent and continued

            <p>Secondly, Chriſt ſends Prophets, that is, ſuch as foretell what ſhall come to paſſe in the laſt dayes; yea, how theſe ſent ones of God ſhall be entertained by the men of the world, to the end thereof; For they are Seers to ſee a far off; yea, what is to be in the utmoſt times, and fartheſt off liſts of eternity in reſpect of time to come<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 2 <hi>Pet.</hi>

            <p>Thirdly, he ſends unto them Wiſe-men, that is, ſuch as have the ſpirit of wiſdom whereby they have ſufficiency of skill to gather up the firſt foundation &amp; riſe of things, ſo as to give them a reall b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ing and exerciſe in the preſent time, according to the proper ſcope and true intent of the Scriptures<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> in what ſoever they expreſſe themſelves; therefore it is that Chriſt ſaith, <hi>before Abraham was, I am<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Iohn</hi> 8. 58. and the gift of Prophecy, which went <hi>before</hi> of <hi>Timothy,</hi> is to be in exerciſe in his preſent miniſtry, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi>

               </gap>. 14.</p>
            <p>As alſo by this ſpirit of wiſdom, the man of God knowes how to cauſe the acts of eternity (with reſpect to things to
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:40942:117"/>
come) joyfully to face about, and ſwiftly to countermarch to our preſent ſtation, and to exerciſe themſelves in the preſent poſtures and operations wherein we are converſant, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 12. 27. 28.</p>
            <p>Therefore it is, that <hi>Luke</hi> differeth the phraſe, abridging them into Prophets and Apoſtles; Now we know that Apoſtles are Leaders to uſher in the death, reſurrection, and aſcenſion of Chriſt, as eye witneſſes thereof; now an eye-witneſſe gives a real preſence to the things teſtified, becauſe his eye doth com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate in the things, elſe is there no ground of certainty for judgement to paſſe, either in order to abſolution or of condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation.</p>
            <p>Alſo a Prophet, foretel ing things to come, muſt likewiſe bring and ſtate them in preſent act and being; for he cannot be known to be a true Prophet, unleſſe the thing foretold become to paſſe, <hi>Ier.</hi> 28. 8. 9. And the reaſon of all this is, becauſe the work of God is an infinite, eternall and undivided act (as him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe is) which illuſtrates and conſerves it ſelfe inpleaſure and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light in the Creature for ever, through the variety of operati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, infinitely comprehended in that one ſimple and intire act; ſo that no time nor place, power, nor de<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

And hence Chriſt brings in that perpetuated act of falſe inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preters of the word of God, in point of their entertainment of theſe Prophets and Apoſtles, who are thus unceſſantly ſent unto them; that is, <hi>Of them ye ſhall kill, and crucifie, and of them ſhall ye ſcourge in your Synagogues and perſecute from City to City.</hi>

            <p>For the firſt, the Spirit of God ſtiles it righteous blood<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and it affirms alſo, that it is the blood of all the Prophets, from the foundation of the World; ſo that there is the ſame guilt, in ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king away the life of any of the Saints or Prophets of God, that is, of any true Interpreter of the word of God, in the preſent age, that ever was in the ſpilling of any righteous blood in the world from the foundation thereof, Chriſt Ieſus himſelfe not exempted for there is but one righteous life and death (as the word blood ſignifies both) which are ever found in Chriſt, and never elſewhere, for in all the operations of life, he is the Lord our righteouſneſſe, <hi>Ier.</hi> 23. 6. by whom we live unto God, <hi>now I live, not I any more, but Chriſt liveth in me, Gal.</hi> 2. 20.</p>
            <p>Again, there is but one righteous blood in point of death un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to ſin and Satan, therefore Chriſt once ſuffered, and once offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red up himſelfe, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3. 18. <hi>Heb.</hi> 9. 26. <hi>Heb.</hi> 10. 10. which is not found but in Chriſt, for it is one act which comprehends all the Saints; therefore the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>I now rejoyce in my ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rings for you, and fill up the remainder,</hi> or that which is behind <hi>of the ſufferings of Chriſt, Col.</hi> 1. 24. that is, I fulfill in my fleſh that off-ſpring or poſterity of the ſuffering of Chriſt, which are common unto that incorporate body, according to the true in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent and meannig thereof; ſhall we think our ſelves to be the off-ſpring and poſterity of Chriſt, and not have the ſimilitude of Chriſt in all things? Was ever ſuch a generation brought forth, that bears not the image of the Progenitor? if we be implanted into his reſurrection, we are implanted into his death alſo, <hi>Romans</hi> 6. 5. if any man have not the Spirit of Chriſt, the ſame is not of his<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
               <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 9. and ſo it may be ſaid of all things that are appropriated to Chriſt, as his peculiar intereſt;
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:40942:122"/>
if any man have not the life of Chriſt, the ſame is none of his<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> if any man have not the wiſdome of Chriſt, the ſame is none of his; and if any man have not the death of Chriſt, that man is none of his; we conclude then there is but one righteous life and death in the true poſterity and off ſpring thereof, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he that ſpills the life by living carnally unto the things of the world, or he that ſpils the death by dying carnally unto the things of God<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that man is guilty of blood in the higheſt degree, for there is but one righteous blood, therefore the ſame guilt and condemnation in the ſhedding thereof, in whom or what age or generation ſoever<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
            </p>
            <p>Moreover, it is but one and the ſame ſpirit of that one word of God, which hath been falſified and cruelly deſtroyed by falſe interpretation, from the foundation of the world, which is that name of Chriſt that none can read but himſelfe; for, <hi>he is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led the word of God, Rev.</hi> 19. 12. 13. Now if the letter of the word were Chriſts name or authority, then any wicked man might read and know the name of Chriſt, yea the Devill him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe in his tentations alleged the letter of the Scripture, <hi>Mat.</hi> 4. 6. compared with <hi>Pſalm</hi> 91. 11. 12. who is ſo far from the knowledge of Chriſt, or from acknowledging him in his ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues to be that which he is; But none can know this name of Chriſt, (namely the word of God) but himſelfe; therefore whereſoever the truth of the word of God is known, there is Chriſt himſelfe, he that is guilty therefore of the neglect, or rejection of the ſpirit of the word of God, or of that law of the ſpirit in whomſoever it is, that perſon is guilty of the neglect, and rejection of Chriſt himſelfe, <hi>Luke</hi> 10. 16. for none hath or knoweth that name but himſelf.</p>
            <p n="2">2 The ſecond point is, how they deal with this blood, where it is ſhed<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that is, on the Earth; falſe interpretation lets the blood of Chriſt, who is heavenly<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> out of its proper place as <hi>Cain</hi> did the blood of <hi>Abel,</hi> which is therefore ſaid to cry from the ground, <hi>Gen.</hi> 4. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>0. it ſpeak, but not as in its proper veines, and place of its naturall reſidency and aboad, contrary to that blood of ſprinkling<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> which is therefore ſaid to ſprinkle, <hi>Heb.</hi> 12<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 24. as having livelyhood and ſpirit in it, to give life and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to the whole body, and therefore ſpeakes better things
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:40942:122"/>
than that of <hi>Abel,</hi> in as much as life is better than death.</p>
            <p>But the blood being ſhed on the Earth, as Chriſt affirms here in this place it is that is, expounded and applyed carnally as that the death of Chriſt ſhould conſiſt in the ſeparation of the ſoul and body of a man living and dying only in ſuch an age or time of the world, and not elſe, thus to draw forth the death or the life of Chriſt, is to ſhed it upon the earth; and as blood ſhed upon the ground is a meanes for the ground to bring forth more abundantly earthly fruits, which are naturall to the ground where it is ſhed, but none of thoſe fruits which it brings forth in the body, the proper place of its reſidency; e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven as the blood of a Lamb ſhed and ſucked up by a Woulf, ceaſeth to have any more the livelyhood and ſpirit of a Lamb in it, but it is now tranſlated and changed by its community with the Woulf (as the ptoper agent to work upon) into the li<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>e, ſpirit, motion, and nature of the Woulf; ſo is it in that way of falſe interpretation, for it takes the ſpirit and life of the word of God out of its proper place, that is to ſay, out of that myſticall body of Chriſt, and will not give it its proper place of its aboad.</p>
            <p>For they ſay that the Saints of God have only ſome created or creature-like vertue, and certain influences of the ſpirit of Chriſt, but not the ſame ſpirit in the reality of it, which the Son of God hath.</p>
            <p>They ſay the Saints of God have a death in them to ſin and Satan, but not the reality of the death of Chriſt.</p>
            <p>They teach that the people of God have the righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of Chriſt, elſe they could not be juſt before God; but it is not in them nor theirs properly, as they are Saints, but it is the righteouſneſſe of another, that is nearer to God than themſelves, and is only imputed to them as others inferior to him.</p>
            <p>Theſe aſſume a life, ſpirit and righteouſneſſe of Chriſt, but confeſſe that the reality of their proper aboad is in another, namely in Chriſt himſelfe, theſe have let out the life and ſpirit of Chriſt into another condition diſtinct from himſelfe, and therefore he is another than they upon whom theſe things are
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:40942:123"/>
imputed and powred out. And hence it is that as blood ſhed on the Earth loſeth its proper ſpirit and life, and the ground con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verting it ſtrengthens it ſelfe thereby, even ſo this doctrine drawes out the blood of Chriſt, ſo as it loſeth its naturall and proper vertue, and is no more the life and ſpirit of the Lamb of God the Saviour of the World, but is become the life and ſpirit of a Woulf ravening and devouring to his utmoſt power the flock of God whereunto he comes, it is no more the life and Spirit of Chriſt, but of Antichriſt; no more the Spirit of God, but is the ſpirit of that evill one.</p>
            <p n="3">3 The third point noted is the time that is<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> from what time it is ſhed, that is, very ancient, namely, from the foundation of the World, that is, this ſpirit of falſe interpretation is the originall ground and cauſe of all bloodſhed and murther that ever was in the World, as it was in that wicked <hi>Cain</hi> who ſlew his brother in the beginning 1 <hi>Iohn</hi> 3. 12. by falſe interpreting of the Sacrifices of God to conſiſt in earthly things, therefore is ſaid to offer the fruits of the ground, <hi>Gen.</hi> 4. 3. unto the Lord, which is his evill work, which the Apoſtle notes to be the cauſe of the murther, ſaying, <hi>And wherefore ſlew he him, but becauſe his own work was evill, and his brothers good,</hi> 1 <hi>Iohn</hi> 3. 12. Even ſo it is unto this day<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> falſe interpretation in car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nallizing the word of God, falſifying that acceptable Sacrifice, which is the firſtling of the Flock that <hi>Abel</hi> brings, this is the cauſe of all murther and bloody perſecution unto this day, for it only upholds the way of <hi>Cain,</hi> and wages of <hi>Balam</hi> in the World, <hi>Jude</hi> 11. which ſpirit of <hi>Cain</hi> kept alive in ceremoniall and traditionall Jews; Chriſt tels them they are of their father the Devill, who is a Murderer from the beginning, alluding to that act of <hi>Cain, Iohn</hi> 8. 44.</p>
            <p n="4">4 The fourth point is, to what time this act of murther reacheth and comes, that is, unto this preſent generation; for as falſe Interpretation is the originall of murther<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and killing of the ſpirit of all the Prophets, ſo alſo it is that off-ſpring preſent ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance, and actor thereof in all ages; for as the wiſdom of God taking the Son of man, or <hi>Adam</hi> earth into unity with it ſelfe, there is bleſſedneſſe and conſervation of eternall li<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

            <p n="5">5 The fifth point is that of them it is required, that is, the blood of all the Prophets of God ſhed from the foundation of the world, is required of the preſent generation, inquiſition for blood being made, it is required at their hands, and God will inquire after, exactly, exquiſitely, or perfectly, as the Greek word <hi>a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="194" facs="tcp:40942:125"/>
this cruelty is exerciſed, the firſt being <hi>Abel,</hi> as <hi>Luke</hi> hath it, <hi>from the blood of Abel,</hi> but <hi>Matthew</hi> addes, <hi>righteous Abel,</hi> whence obſerve that we are not to take up a name, or to uſe it uponany occaſion, title, or epithite given in the word of God, but as we conſider the nature of the thing therin included, otherwiſe we uſe the name in vaine, it is an empty and fruitleſſe title un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to us, without truth and ſubſtance, and carrieth not in it, as conveying unto us, the weight of Gods purpoſe and appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment unto his people.</p>
            <p>Therefore when we uſe the word <hi>Lord,</hi> as ſpeaking from the Lord unto others, if there ariſe not in our hearts a royal courage and authority, as having dominion over whatever might oppoſe his truth, with confidence of proſperous ſucceſſe to accompliſh his holy ends, otherwiſe we participate not in the nature of the name uſed in that reſpect, and God never gave name without the nature accompanying the ſame; therefore every Creature in the beginning had its name according to its nature; if the name of God therefore be called upon us, or we called by his name, <hi>Jer.</hi> 14. 9. we have the nature of it alſo, or elſe it is an empty and vain title, which the wiſdom of God never gives to any. Again, if we uſe the name <hi>Lord,</hi> as ſpeaking to God in Prayer or Thanksgiving, then there is annexed unto it in our hearts, a ready, willing, chearfull and voluntary ſubmiſſion and obedience unto his will in all things, otherwiſe it is but an empty and fruitleſſe title.</p>
            <p>Likewiſe if we uſe the title or tearm <hi>Father,</hi> as we exerciſe the place of gravity, <hi>beſeeching men in Chriſts ſtead to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciled unto God,</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 20, then are our hearts poſſeſſed and repleniſhed with a ſpirit of tenderneſſe, and bowels of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſion earn within us, <hi>Hoſea</hi> 11. 8. or elſe we take that name of God in vain, in that reſpect it is an empty title unto us<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and God will not hold him guiltleſſe that takes his name up as a bare and empty term, <hi>Exod.</hi> 20 7.</p>
            <p>Alſo if we uſe the name <hi>Father,</hi> as we appeal unto God for inſtruction, protection and ſupply, then doth the diſpoſition of a Child fill our hearts, as though we ſtood in no other relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on but of a Child to a tender and compaſſionate father, for the Spirit of God is full in all its operations.</p>

Adde further, (but that which might be added in this point is infinite) if we take up the name or title of <hi>King,</hi> we muſt bring in therewith the true nature of eternity and immortality, the only wiſe God, who reigns in peace, is glorious, and hath everlaſting life, <hi>Pſalm</hi> 93. 1. <hi>Heb.</hi> 7. 1. 2. 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1. 17. unto whom all glory doth appertain and belong, and to none elſe (what ever he be) where that Princely ſpirit is not found, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe we meaſure and account of our ſelves, according to tranſient titles, offices and actions, a rule wherby the Son of God never took form unto himſelf, nor doth he account of any thing in his condition and Kingdome, according to the worth or dignity of any momentany thing whatſoever, but only takes them up as <hi>Gideons</hi> ſouldiers did the water out of the Brook with their hands, not to lodge and lie down by the River, but took up that contained in the River as a furtherance and helpe to their proper intent and deſign; and thoſe that lie down by them, by lodging the word of God in them, they may turne back into Egypt from whence they came, for they are no ſoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers of our Lord Ieſus Chriſt, they do but take up his name in vaine, without the nature annexed to the ſame, <hi>Iudg.</hi> 7. 5. 6. 7. 8.</p>

            <p>There is then a vanity accompanied with vexation of ſpirit, as in <hi>Cain,</hi> who is emptied of the glory and peace of God, who fears that all that ſees him will kill him, <hi>Gen.</hi> 4. 14. And there is alſo a vanity accompanied with the breath and ſpirit of the Lord, in the propagating of the Son of God in the way of <hi>Seth,</hi> in whom the ſpirit of the Lord breaths in the blaſting of all humane glory, and emptying man of all carnal reaſonings, that the glory and wiſdome of God may take place, and become the fulneſſe of that ſtate and condition, <hi>Iſaiah</hi> 40<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 6. 7. 8.</p>
            <p>The vanity filled with vexation, which is that evill ſpirit of <hi>Saul,</hi> is man emptied of all the vertues proper to that holy Son of God<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> which emptineſſeis the filling of him with that evil ſpirit of Satan, which is that enmity againſt Chriſt, and if there were not through Gods deviſe, a ſpirit, a ſtate, and condition of this Satanicall nature, corrupt and vile, and that in all re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects, and eternally, otherwiſe there had never been footing for the appearances of Gods glory in the ſalvation of any of the ſons of men, nor had his power and proper vertue ever been made known to the Creature to render to the Creator the praiſe thereof.</p>
            <p>For if there were not a damnable and deſtructive eſtate and condition in man<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that is, in man ſo depraved and corrupted, there had never been deliverance of man into the glory and purity of the Son of God, yea, and that the deſtruction be of

the ſame capacity and duration that the deliverance is, other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe there had never been ground for deliverance and ſalvation, ſuch as becomes the preſence, the onely Son, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency of the work of an infinitely wiſe, allſufficient and an eternall God.</p>
            <p>For what is ſalvation in reality more than the deſtruction that it ſaveth from, and how can the reality of mercy be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended further than the nature of the miſery which it taketh the commiſerated from, and what is an acquitting and clearing either for ſum or ſubſtance, further than there is weight and duration in the guilt and condemnation.</p>
            <p>Yea, the glory of God vaniſheth and comes to nought, in point of any eternall ſalvation of man, if there be not an eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall damnation and deſtruction of man. For what thanks worthy is there to ſave from nothing; for if mankind be not eternally deſtroyed, then man is ſaved from nothing, if no eternall deſtruction be; and if man be ſaved from temporary evils, then hath he only a temporary ſalvation, and than the creature hath the glory of the ſalvation, no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

            <p>Therefore <hi>Abel</hi> is become vain and empty in his brother <hi>Cain</hi> (though propagated of the ſame ſtock) to the fulneſſe of vexation in that ſpirit of enmity, being in him made void and emptied of all that love, life and vertue which is proper to the Son of God, elſe were there no place for the glory of God in ſalvation to be found, nor had it ever been heard of among the ſons of men, nor had it any ground or baſis to ſtand upon; and to enervate ſalvation is no leſſe then to enervate the Son of God himſelfe, for it is he alone who is our ſalvation, <hi>Pſalm</hi> 27. 1. <hi>Pſalm</hi> 14. 7. let ſuch as hold a univerſall ſalvation of all men take notice of this point, and let others obſerve their a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bominable laſcivious and looſe tenent, that they hold in the truth and intent of their doctrine, that there is neither God nor Devill, nor man in better eſtate than a bruit beaſt<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Again,

And without an emptineſſe of man, in both theſe reſpects from the firſt act of his ordination or creation, the full, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat death of Chriſt is never known, nor doth it appear in the world unto ſalvation, which ſets man at an utter diſtance from God in <hi>Cain,</hi> with reſpect unto <hi>Abel,</hi> as alſo it ſets man in unity with God in <hi>Seth,</hi> with reſpect to the ſame <hi>Abel,</hi> he being ſet in his ſtead, and the father of Chriſt, <hi>Luke</hi> 3. 23.-38.</p>
            <p>And from this twofold vanity, the death of the Son of God is forever perfected, for in that way of <hi>Cain,</hi> he is dead to al heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and ſpiritual vertue, as he is the Son of God, and yet God in the exerciſe of wrath and diſpleaſure is really there; and in <hi>Seth</hi> he is dead to all earthly and carnall things, as he is the Son of Sons, man and yet man in exerciſe of goodneſſe and love, is really there, and without reſpect to theſe twain, the death of Chriſt is not revealed, for it is not part of Chriſt that ſuffers for the ſalvation of man, as only in his manhood, as the blind Phariſees of the world hold and teach, but it is Chriſt compleat, who conſiſts of God and man; and in the ſame re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect he is ſaid to dye, he never lives, therefore it is ſaid <hi>that he is dead, and is alive,</hi> as the words may be truly read, <hi>Rev.</hi> 1. 18. <hi>Rev.</hi> 2. 8. And from this death of the Son of God in this two<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold reſpect, there flows a twofold righteouſneſſe or juſtice, namely, of abſolution and of condemnation, <hi>Mat.</hi> 25. 34. 41. <hi>Pſalm</hi> 6. 8.</p>
            <p>And if it were not for this death of Chriſt, thus conſidered, there were no place for the righteouſneſſe of Faith, in the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe of mercy, nor for that of the Scribes and Phariſes in that exerciſe of Gods ſeverity, <hi>Rom.</hi> 11. 22. <hi>Rom.</hi> 9. 22. 23. but Gods glory were extinct in both reſpects, and therefore he is righteous <hi>Abel.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For if a wicked man could content himſelf ſimply with the Creature in his relation to it, as the bruit beaſts do, then were there no ſeverity of God to be exerciſed in way of the curſe, for there were no ground nor footing for it.</p>
            <p>But man hath a ſpirit, (as it appears in <hi>Gain)</hi> that will inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit acceptation with God as well as his brother, though in that way of an earthly and carnall ſacrifice, whereby it cometh to paſſe, that he kils his brother cauſeleſly, nay he kils him be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe

his own works are evill, and his brothers good, even as all wicked men quench and kill the ſpirit and life of Chriſt Ieſus in their own hearts by their earthly and carnall thoughts and ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination of that good word and work of God in point of ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalvation, 1 <hi>Iohn</hi> 3. 12. which is the kindling of wrath in our ſoules, for as it was in <hi>Cain,</hi> ſo it is in all ſuch as <hi>wander in the way of Caein, Iude</hi> 11.</p>
            <p>For according to the worth and dignity of the perſon, whoſe life is extinct and taken away, which is the ſpirit and life of the Son of God, of ſuch wce and weight is the nature and guilt of his ſin for ſo doing, which can never be recovered, nor healed, and accordingly the weight of juſtice, and Gods ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity muſt of neceſſity go forth in the exerciſes of ſelf in his juſt condemnation and execution thereof.</p>
            <p>And as the ſpirit of man naturally (being made one with God) inclineth and ſeeketh after God whereby to honour and dignifie it ſelfe with his titles and excellencies, without which he cannot make himſelf Lord of all, <hi>Gen.</hi> 1. 28. which carnally enterpriſed works ſuch effect: So alſo there is naturally in the Son of God an aptitude and propenſity unto man for the revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and manifeſtation of himſelf, in all his vertues, according to the fulneſſe thereof, which cannot be but by the crucifying of the fleſh in all the affections and luſts thereof, <hi>Gal.</hi> 5. 24. which is a work of no leſſe weight than the overcoming of Satan himſelf, which none but the Son of God himſelf can do, <hi>Heb.</hi> 2. 14. which conqueſt and <hi>v<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

And it is a certain and undeniable truth as Chriſt the Son of God is ſet forth and taught
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:40942:128"/>
herein; that he who is the Creator and Maker of all things, emptyeth himſelf, and becomes vain in all things both of fleſh and ſpirit, that he thereby may manifeſt himſelf to have the glory of all things, not only of life, but alſo of death; for in that he dies to the things of the Spirit in the wicked, he thereby riſeth in wrath through the wiſdom of the fleſh; and in that he dies unto the fleſh in the Saints, he riſeth in mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy and peace, in the exerciſes of the ſpirit, whereby he hath the glory of all things, which otherwiſe could ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver be.</p>
            <p>For as man in Chriſt hath the righteouſneſſe and glory of God, and yet nothing can be attributed to the things naturall, proper to man, in that wonderfull work of Gods Creation: even ſo God in Antichriſt hath the ſin and ſhame of Satan, and yet nothing of that condition can be attributed to any thing naturally proper to God, in that wonderfull deſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Devill.</p>
            <p>And with reſpect unto vanity thus diſtributed it is called the bloods of thy brother, in the form plurall, <hi>Gen.</hi> 4. 10. And it ſpeaks guilt and terrour, from the ground, or earthly heart of <hi>Cain,</hi> that ſo drinks it in, <hi>Gen.</hi> 4. 11. and it alſo ſpeaks as a witneſſe of acceptation with God by faith in that way of <hi>Seth,</hi> who is that ſet one unto this day, of whom is Chriſt, who yet ſpeaketh, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11. 4 for though <hi>Abel</hi> be cut off from all ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion of mercy, in that way of carnall ſacrifices in <hi>Cain,</hi> yet hath he a ſucceſſion of terrour in <hi>Cains</hi> heart, <hi>Gen.</hi> 4. 13. 14. ſo alſo though he have no ſucceſſion according to the fleſh in that acceptable Sacrifice of the firſtling of the flock, being dead in that reſpect in the way of <hi>Seth,</hi> yet hath he his ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion and language in the witneſſe and acceptation of faith unto this day, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11. 4. And according to this vanity or emptineſſe through one eternall act, God is truly ſaid to fill all things through that deſcenſion and aſcenſion of his Son Chriſt, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 4. 10. therefore <hi>Cain</hi> is ſaid to be a poſſeſſion, and <hi>Seth</hi> a ſet one; for hereby both life and death are poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed and eternally inherited.</p>
            <p>That is life in that way of <hi>Seth,</hi> wherin the generation of the ſon of God is found, as the off-ſpring of <hi>Adam</hi> from the cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:40942:129"/>
of all things, firmly founded for ever, and death in that way of <hi>Cain,</hi> as one caſt out from the family and face of God, being become a Vagabond, in whom Satan that ſon of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition is, as another generation and off-ſpring from the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of the world; therefore Satan is ſaid to <hi>be a lyer from the beginning, Iohn</hi> 8. 44. as it is ſaid of Chriſt, <hi>in the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning was the Word, Iohn</hi> 1. 1. the one being called the ſeed of the Woman, the other the ſeed of the Serpent, <hi>Gen.</hi> 3. 15. <hi>Cain</hi> therefore being thus caſt out, and alienated from the Lord, he names no houſe nor family from which he had his wife, to ſignifie that he was quite cut off from the family of his father, and from the creation of God, <hi>Gen.</hi> 4. 16. 17.</p>
            <p>And therefore God arraigns mankind in this way of <hi>Cain,</hi> concerning his ſin and guilt, and gives him up to be both Iudg and alſo Executioner in himſelf, arguing himſelf in his own conſcience a ſinner, and exerciſing wrath upon himſelf for it, <hi>Gen.</hi> 4. 6. 16. for it is God in Chriſt, who is the party of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended, and therefore another, and not properly Chriſt the Saviour, who ſentenceth to death, and performs execution; therefore as God is conſidered in Chriſt, he is no more the proper Judge of the wicked than he is the proper Executio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of wrath, and he ſaith of himſelf in that reſpect, anger or <hi>fury is not in me, Iſai.</hi> 27. 4. And the Iudge and the Exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutioner are ever conſidered as one, for the Iudge gives not ſentence, but with reſpect to the Executioner, for otherwiſe his ſentence is not in force.</p>
            <p>Therefore it may ſeem ſtrange that the Hangman ſits not on the bench with the Iudge to communicate in the ſentence of the Law, to know upon what grounds he executes, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the knowledge whereof, he is no better than a Murderer, as well as the Iudge hath reſpect to the Executioner for the finiſhing and perfecting of his ſentence, or elſe he is no bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter than a competitor with a murderer, if execution be not done where juſt demerits appear.</p>
            <p>The party offended therefore, which is Chriſt, is not the proper Iudge of the wicked, no more than he hath that ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vile office upon him of being their Executioner, for it is the proper officeof the Devil both to accuſe and torment, <hi>Rev.</hi>
               <pb n="203" facs="tcp:40942:129"/>
12. 10. therefore his name in <hi>Hebrew</hi> is <hi>Abaddon,</hi> and in Greek he is called <hi>Apollyon,</hi> that is, deſtroying, <hi>Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations</hi> 9. 11.</p>
            <p n="2">2 In the condemnation of the wicked, there muſt be no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing ſound in the fact of putting Chriſt to death, that can ſavour of any goodneſſe to him that condemns; for then pure ſeverity and ſtrictneſſe of juſtice to the uttermoſt can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not take place to anſwer that mercy exerciſed in Chriſt, who is ſaid to ſave to the uttermoſt and fartheſt extent, <hi>Heb.</hi> 7. 25. and ſo muſt condemnation come upon the wicked unto the uttermoſt, 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 2. 16.</p>
            <p>But God in Chriſt cannot behold that act of the world, in crucifying of Chriſt, but he muſt behold that voluntary act of his holy Son laying down his life therein, as the Lamb of God taking away the ſins of the World, in that his be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a ranſome for all the Elect and choſen of God, <hi>Iohn</hi> 1. 29. <hi>Hoſea</hi> 13. 14. <hi>Mat.</hi> 20. 28.</p>
            <p>Therefore the ſentence of death, and execution of wrath muſt needs reſide properly in the wicked themſelves, in whom is nothing but wrath and cruelty, nor can they behold any thing that ſhould in the leaſt aſſwage or diminiſh the ſame, and therefore it is wrath to the uttermoſt, even as the Saints cannot behold any thing in Chriſt that may im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paire or diminiſh their joy, and therefore it is ſalvation to the uttermoſt.</p>
            <p n="3">3 Conſider, that in the ſentence of abſolution, it muſt be uttered compleatly in the party acquitted, otherwiſe if any title thereof ſhould reſide in, or concern an other then the party acquitted had not the full poſſeſſion and fruition there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, and then it were not ſalvation to the uttermoſt, in caſe the ſentence, both as it is given, and alſo as it is received were not found in him who is acquitted, the abſolver, and the ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved being one, which is only found in that throne of grace, erected in Chriſt, where the boldneſſe of him that ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peals, and him who is appealed unto, are but one, <hi>Heb.</hi> 4. 16. otherwiſe the King Chriſt could not be ſaid to come in ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving himſelf as the holy Ghoſt affirms he doth, <hi>Za<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chary</hi> 9. 9.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="204" facs="tcp:40942:130"/>
Likewiſe in the way of death and condemnation, it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be full unleſſe the ſentence and the ſentenced be in one, the party condemning and condemned, the Iudge and the Executioner, elſe wrath cannot be to the uttermoſt, as the wrath of God, who is infinite and everlaſting, without li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitation in all things; thence it is that Chriſt ſaith to the wicked Iews, even of our times, <hi>I condemn you not, there is one that condemns you, even Moſes in whom you truſt, Iohn</hi> 4. 45. That is the word of God according to the letter that kils, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3. 6. the word carnalized, as thoſe wicked Iews did the writings of <hi>Moſes,</hi> to the crucifying of the Son of God by their law, <hi>Iohn</hi> 19. 7. <hi>Iohn</hi> 12. 34. ſo falſely inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preted.</p>
            <p>Thoſe then that are ſaid to be on Chriſts left hand, that are condemned, the ſentence ariſeth, and is utered from the curſe, which is not in any other, but in themſelves; <hi>Go ye curſed into everlasting fire prepared for the Devill and his An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels, Matthew</hi> 25. 41.</p>
            <p>So likewiſe to them on his right hand, the invitation and bleſſing in their abſolution and entrance into the Kingdom, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſeth out of the bleſſed eſtate, which is not in any other but in the parties bleſſed, <hi>Ma<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>.</hi> 25. 34. So that the word of God preacheth it ſelf, and gives ſentence according to the proper ſubject in whom it is, both in point of life, as alſo of death; of life in the true interpretation thereof, according to Gods minde and intent, which is never out of, but in himſelf, who is bleſſed for ever, <hi>Rom.</hi> 9. 5. and ſo is that truth and life, which Chriſt affirms himſelf to be, <hi>Iohn</hi> 14. 6. And it gives ſentence of death in them, by whom it is falſely interpreted, for in them it proves a lie, which the Devill is ſaid to be, <hi>Iohn</hi> 8. 44 and ſo it becomes to all them in whom it is falſely con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed and interpreted.</p>
            <p>We conclude then, that there is a righteouſneſſe in <hi>Hebel,</hi> according to his name in Hebrew, or in <hi>Abel,</hi> according to the Greek, or a righteouſneſs in vanity or emptineſs, the name and the adjunct being but one, yea even the Son of God is made vain and empty, to the end he may fill all things, and is made nothing that he may ſubſtantiate all things, for ſo
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:40942:130"/>
much is in thoſe words tranſlated, he was made of no repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, that is, he was made vain, empty, nothing, as the word ſignifies; that is, he is nothing in point of the ſpirit and life in the wicked, that they may be filled with horrour, mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tality and wrath; and he is nothing in point of the fleſh and glory of man in the godly, that they may be filled with the fulneſſe of God, in immortality and eternal life and peace; and ſo much for preſent concerning the word <hi>Abel,</hi> together with the adjunct righteous <hi>Abel.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The ſecond point concerns the manner of this fact of mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thering the Prophets, which either aggravates, or extenuates an act, and that is ſaid to be from blood to blood; that is, <hi>from the blood of</hi> Abel <hi>to the blood of</hi> Zacharia: By Abels blood here that is, his ſlaughter, we are to underſtand the ſacrifice for which he was ſlain; for <hi>Cain</hi> ſlew him for the goodneſſe of his work or offering, 1 <hi>Iohn</hi> 3. 12. now we know that Chriſt is the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice offered, as really as he is the Sacrificer that offers it; therefore in <hi>Abel</hi> he is ſaid to be a Lamb ſlain from the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning, <hi>Rev.</hi> 13. 8. alſo our Apoſtle affirms, <hi>that Chriſt our Paſſeover is Sacrificed for us,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 7. where he concludes him to be the Sacrifice; ſo that the ſlaughter of <hi>Abel,</hi> is the unnaturall murthering of the true offering, or that illegall en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity which <hi>Cain</hi> hath againſt Chriſt, being brought in as the only acceptable thing unto God; for <hi>he that hates his brother is a Murtherer, and we know that no Murtherer hath eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall life abiding in him,</hi> 1 <hi>Iohn</hi> 3. 15.</p>
            <p>For <hi>Abel</hi> bringing the firſtling of the Flock, which is the firſt-born of God, not at <hi>Cain,</hi> was the prime, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the judgment of the fleſh, as one judged, who the Apoſtle ſaith was deceived, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11. 3.</p>
            <p>But he is the firſt born, or he that opens the womb of eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall generation, and true off-ſpring of God to appear in man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, and that by emptying man of all humane and tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rary glory and excellencies, to be filled and repleniſhed with the glory of God only, in the excellencies of his holy Spirit in all the operations thereof; and the nature of that firſtling <hi>Cain</hi> could never abide, who is that firſt-born after the
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:40942:131"/>
fleſh and judgment of humane wiſdome, who builds Cities and ſeverall Orders and Inſtitutions, calling them by the name given to his Son, to glorifie himſelf in an Off-ſpring of mortall and carnall things, <hi>Gen.</hi> 4. 17. calling this City <hi>Enoch<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

            <p>Again, Chriſt is not only made vain, according to all carnall things in this his offering, in his whole and intire myſticall body, but alſo he becomes bereaved of all things of the ſpirit in wicked men, who are void of all the operations thereof, that ſo the depths of Satan may take place, which is as much as to ſay the Creator and giver of life and being to all things is become death, as alſo in that way of Chriſt, that the Creature is become eternall life, which can have no other ſound in a carnall ear, but as though the Creator were dead, and the Creature become God, which <hi>Cain</hi> in all his Off-ſpring could never indure to hear of, neither of the one nor of the other, for in the one the glory of man is conſumed as the graſſe, <hi>Iſaiah</hi> 40. 6. which humane wiſdome can never in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure, and in the other ſtands the ſhame of Satan, in the quenching of all the fruits of the ſpirit, which the pride of man can never indure, but utterly denies both the one and the other to be the true Off-ſpring and Sacrifice of the Son God, yea rejects and contemns, and is in enmity againſt them both, which enmity is the ſlaughter of the Son of God, as he hath given himſelf to be this firſtling offered for the redemption of his choſen ones, for he that hates his brother kils him, 1 <hi>Iohn</hi> 3. 15. as well as <hi>he that lookes upon a woman to luſt after her hath committed adultery with her in his heart already, Mat.</hi> 5. 28. even ſo he that hath enmity againſt the ſacrifice of God he hath ſtrangled it in his heart already, and not taken away the blood according to Gods order and

            <p>Therefore the blood of the Prieſt is brought in upon the ſame account againſt them who ſlew <hi>Abel,</hi> that they have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo ſlain <hi>Zachariah</hi> the ſon of <hi>Barachiah,</hi> as being that holy Prophet and Prieſt of God, the cauſe and manner of whoſe death is recorded in that ſecond of <hi>Chronicles,</hi> Chapter twenty four.

            <p>The ſlaughter then was in the Court of the houſe of the Lord, as is expreſſed by the Prophet, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 24. 21. And Chriſt opening the myſtery of that Hiſtoricall Narration, ſaith it is done between the Temple and the Altar, to declare that wicked and idolatrous Kings, Prieſts, Princes and Elderſhips of the world, falſe Expounders, Interpreters, and Prevarica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors of the Law of God, will never permit that ſuch an offering or ſacrifice ſhall be laid upon the Altar of God, nor ſuch an Officer as is only authorized and furniſhed with and by the Spirit of God to enter into the Temple or houſe of the Lord to exerciſe in point of worſhip, ſo far as their power and authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty can put forth it ſelf to prevaile againſt them, therefore they permit them not to come neither into the Temple, nor upon the Altar, but ſlay them betwixt them both, for their act of murder in that place is referred as well unto <hi>Abel</hi> as unto <hi>Zachariah.</hi>

For if a miniſtry according to Gods wiſdome ſhould be admitted by the world, then would the wiſdome of the world be in ſubordination to the wiſdome of God, and the calling of a Chriſtian would prove more immediate from God than any other office or calling in the world, and then would a Chriſtian prove the only and ſupream perſon or ſtate in the world, which is an honour which the ſpirit of the world could never allow unto the King of Saints, which may ſeem ſtrange that they ſhould conclude that a Chriſtian ſhall have chiefty of, and ſupremacy over all wicked men hereafter, and yet cannot yeeld it unto them for the preſent, but rather muſt Lord it over them, according to the doctrine of the Scribes, <hi>Luke</hi> 23. 2. <hi>Mat.</hi> 22. 16. 17. 18. whereas the Scripture ſpeaks ſo expreſly, that a thouſand years in Gods ſight are as yeſterday, when it is paſt, <hi>Pſalm</hi> 90. 4. Nay, the holy Ghoſt concludes that our time here is as nothing <hi>Pſalm</hi> 39. 5. and if ſo, then how ſhall we reckon a man in another conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on than he ſhall be hereafter in Gods account, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:40942:136"/>
to whoſe reckoning and Records, we ought to judge?</p>
            <p>To conclude this point, an Officer of Gods ordination and appointment, clothed with the Spirit of God, cannot be admitted into that carnall Temple, where <hi>Ioaſh</hi> bears ſway, and hath rule and command, but in the loſſe of his life; for where Chriſt is in office, he is exalted above all the ordinations of men, therefore is <hi>Zachariah</hi> ſlain between the Temple and the Altar, not being permitted to enter with life into the ſame, the world therefore in the letter of the Scriptures only retains a dead carkaſſe of the Prophets, being void of the life and ſpirit in all the vertues thereof, kept in that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition only through falſe and counterfeit interpretation.</p>
            <p>The fourth point, is the Application of the Fact unto the parties preſent, in theſe words, <hi>whom ye ſlew,</hi> as <hi>Matthew</hi> hath it, particularly applying the fact unto them of that preſent age; <hi>Luke</hi> ſaith, who periſhed, or which was ſlain, as giving being unto the fact in times paſt; or who periſhed, or periſheth, for of ſuch ſcope and comprehenſion the words are, noting a continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed act which comprehends time paſt, preſent, and to come; for it is but one only Sacrifice which they thus ſtrangle, <hi>Heb.</hi> 9. 26. <hi>Heb.</hi> 10. 10. and ſlay contrary to Gods ordinance and appointment. <hi>Act.</hi> 15. 20 29 not taking the blood, or the life away, according to the law<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

               </gap>. 23. ſo that it is but one bloodſhed, and it is but one Officer which is excluded their Temple, who hath all offices upon him, whom they thus ſlay, denying all rule and authority, that is of the nature of that inſtalling, contemning all exerciſe of the party ſo inſtalled in all times and ages of the world, <hi>Pſalm</hi> 2. 1. 2. 3. <hi>Acts</hi> 4. 25.-29.</p>
            <p>Again, it is but one ſpirit and life of the word of God, which they ſpightfully ſpill, and let out in an earthly manner, as <hi>Cain</hi> did the blood of <hi>Abel, Pſalm</hi> 79. 1. 2. 3. and it is but one ſpirit of enmity, and falſifying of the word of God, which is extant in all the ſeed and off-ſpring of the Serpent, <hi>Gen.</hi> 3. 15. and therefore the fact in the full comprehenſion and operation thereof, is really applicable to parties of that race

and ſpirit of the Serpent in all times and ages of the world, as really as the whole ſalvation of God, and not a part or pittance thereof is applicable to every particular beleever, in any, or in all ages of the world, and to tye the ſalvation of God unto any time, or party concerned in that myſtical body of Chriſt, more than to any other, is to divide Chriſt, and may as well ſay that <hi>Paul</hi> was crucified for us, as to aſcribe more power of ſalvation to one Saint than to another, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

            <p>Therefore in the fifth place Chriſt affirms in way of an aſſeveration or oath, ſaying, Verily, Amen or So be it, to that which he hath, and ſhall affirm, concerning this matter, being irrevocable, confirmed by an avowed ſentence, which depends upon the truth and certainty of his being, the word of God, to perform and put in execution the ſame; <hi>Verily, I ſay unto you, that all theſe things ſhall come upon this genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> that is, in how many reſpects, that one Sacrifice of Chriſt is offered up to God, as an holy and acceptable offering, which is multiplyed according to the ſeverall Sacrifices and Offerings appointed by the law, which are innumerable in ſo many reſpects ſhall guilt in the annihilating of all theſe things come upon this generation of falſe interpretation of the law of God, and alſo by how much the offices and Officers by the appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of God are multiplyed in way of Family, Tribe, City.

            <p>The truth is, that the argument or wiſdome of a Saint encouraging him to ſtand in oppoſition unto all the world, (which he cannot but do though there were not another to ſtand by him in the cauſe of God) is to carnall reaſon liker to a man bereaved of his ſenſes, than one in his right mind; and thence it is, that <hi>Cham</hi> the youngeſt ſon of <hi>Noah,</hi> or the leaſt ſon being ſo diminiſhed in point of Sonſhip that he comes not within the compaſſe of inheriting any part of his fathers bleſſing, becauſe he looking upon his father as being un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered of all the ornaments of mans power and wiſdome, and ſo aſleep or dead to them all, whom <hi>Cham</hi> declares to his bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren as the ſhame of his father, looking upon him with that unclean ſpirit of the Raven, but <hi>Sem</hi> and <hi>Iaphet</hi> beheld not any ſhame in that nakedneſſe, but know it to be the only capacity of their father to be clothed with thoſe honourable robes of righteouſneſſe, which they bear upon their ſhoulders as the Levites carry the Ark of God, and go backwards unto their father, a quite contrary way than <hi>Cham</hi> doth; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>Noah</hi> awaking unto God, or being alive unto the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, as really as dead to the fleſh, exerciſing himſelf in the wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of the ſpirit, knows what his ſons have done through this his ſleep and drunkenneſſe, miniſtring unto them accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to their deed; and therefore denounceth a curſe againſt <hi>Canaan,</hi> not naming <hi>Cham,</hi> but <hi>Canaan</hi> his ſon, wherein a deep myſtery is couched; namely, that the curſe doth not in the leaſt ariſe out of the Ark, wherein ſalvation is, but out of a ſpirit propagated and ingendred, by concluding that the glory of ſalvation conſiſts in that which it doth not, namely in the glory of the Creature, and not in that glory which is immediately of God, even as <hi>Cham</hi> lookt at the blaſting of mans glory, through the power of the holy ſpirit of God, to be the ſhame of his father, and not the true glory.</p>
            <p>Neither doth the curſe ariſe and ſpring out of any proper work or operation of God in any particular, but from a falſe conſtruction and interpretation made of that good work of God; therefore the act of ingendring <hi>Canaan,</hi> as accurſed <hi>merchandizing</hi> (as his name ſignifies) by a falſe conſtruction
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:40942:142"/>
concerning our deliverance (given by <hi>Cham)</hi> comes between <hi>Noah,</hi> and the bleſſing diſtributed to his ſons; and however <hi>Cham</hi> be not named in denouncing the curſe, yet he is inclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, elſe the curſe were not full in originall and off-ſpring, even as the bleſſing is pronounced upon the root and originall of bleſſing; and therefore he ſaith, <hi>bleſſed be the Lord God of Shem,</hi> but <hi>Shem</hi> the true off ſpring is included, and ſo it is full in the root and branch alſo.</p>
            <p>So is the curſe denounced upon <hi>Canaan,</hi> but <hi>Cham</hi> is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded alſo, elſe the curſe were not full in root and off-ſpring; and as <hi>Noah</hi> here in this place, is not the immediate root of <hi>Canaan</hi> the accurſed, no more is the Lord of all the Earth the immediate root of any particular in the curſe.</p>
            <p>That ſpirit therefore that ſtands for mediate Ordinances and offices of God, it ſtands for and upholds the proper pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pagation of the curſe; and as the curſe goeth out unto <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naan</hi> the ſon of perdition, including <hi>Cham</hi> the father of lies; ſo Chriſt here denounceth deſolation upon the Mother <hi>Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſalem,</hi> including all falſe Interpreters her Children, in the Scribes and Phariſees, as her proper off-ſpring; and thus comes the curſe to be propagated in all the men of the World and the orders thereof conſtituted and eſtabliſhed (if we may call it order eſtabliſhed) in all the Cities of the Iebuſites, namely, by preferring the wiſdome, power, authority and glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of man, before the wiſdome, power, authority and glory of God, maintaining the wayes and operations of the Creature in the vilifying of the operations of the ſpirit of God, as a ſhamefull thing in that way of the croſſe of Chriſt, and in this ſtands all thoſe mother like conceptions in the orders of the World, to produce and bring forth a brood and generati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of falſe Interpreters, as the orders of <hi>Ieruſalem</hi> had brought forth theſe Scribes and Phariſees, as her children in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gendred by that bond woman, or ſpirit of bondage. For the orders conſtituted and eſtabliſhed in the world, beget falſe In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpreters, as naturally as every Creature begets and conceivs its own kind, for according to the form of order eſtabliſhed in any nation, Kingdom or juriſdiction, ſuch is the officer it brings forth, for he muſt be produced and eſtabliſhed accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding

to that law, or elſe he is a Uſurper; ſo that the immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate call, and inviſible vertue of the Spirit of God, is thereby to be rejected in whomſoever it appears; for the Officer muſt be a child of that order and law wherin he exerciſeth, of what order and conſtitution ſoever it be, which this City or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of <hi>Iebus,</hi> or <hi>Ieruſolem</hi> hath ordained and erected, and here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in ſhe becomes murtherous and diabolicall in her ſelf and in her children, or the children are ſuch in the mother, and the mother is ſuch in the children, in that they reject all im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate revelation of Chriſt and his Spirit, putting it off by their law to a time paſt or to come, or to both, and ſo kill it in the preſent time, as theſe Interpreters did, and as the City ordains and appoints ſuch laws to bring forth children by, ſo the children are bound to promote maintain and juſtifie that law and order by which they are brought forth.</p>
            <p>Even as children do their Parents, whilſt they ſtand in that relation of children; for when they are once betrothed, they become a root in themſelves, and theſe two taken ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritually according to the intent of Scripture are never ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated, whether in the myſtery of God, or in the myſtery of iniquity, namely the root and the branch, the mother, as City order, and her children; ſo that as falſe Teachers look back they are the children of an accurſed mother, or ſeed of an adulterous law of the carnall commandement; and as they look forward at the fruit and off ſpring of their doctrine, ſo they are the root or mother City of an accurſed off-ſpring, whoſe inhabitants are no other than the accurſed Iebuſites, enemies to <hi>Ieruſalem,</hi> that is above, and to the Iſrael of God, <hi>Gal.</hi> 4. 26. <hi>Gal.</hi> 6. 16.</p>
            <p>This City therefore, namely <hi>Ieruſalem,</hi> ordered by the law of a carnall commandement, which is to expound the bond and tie of the word of God (as Gods intent) to ſtand in the relation of one Creature to another, in any thing where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in God expreſſeth himſelf.</p>

3. 1. and therefore wo is denounced againſt her as the <hi>bloody City, Ezek.</hi> 24. 6. 9.</p>
            <p>And ſo much for the acclamation and ingemination of the phraſe, Oh <hi>Ieruſalem, Ieruſalem;</hi> and hence it is that Chriſt brings in that juſt and deſerved charge, which is the ſecond point, <hi>Thou that killeſt the Prophets, and ſtoneſt them that are ſent unto thee;</hi> wherein obſerve two things, firſt that they kill the Prophets; ſecondly, that they ſtone them who are ſent unto them.</p>
            <p n="1">1 They kill the Prophets, for this order and City govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment contrived by the letter of the Scripture, for the main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining of the glory, wealth, honour of the Creature cannot preſerve it ſelf therein, but by impriſoning or cutting off what ever ſeems to impaire the ſame; Now the wiſdome of God which hath placed all honour, wealth and happineſſe only in things that indure for ever, cannot but vilifie and bring to nought all fading and tranſient things, and therefore our Apoſtle affirms, that the wiſdom of the Princes, or moſt excellent, and men of eſteem of this world comes to nought, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2. 6.</p>
            <p>Therefore the orders and inſtitutions of this City, that is, of all carnall policies and ſtates, leaning only upon the letter of the Scripture, muſt of neceſſity bend their force againſt that wiſdome and word of eternity, as the only enemy of their pomp and glory, being a ſhame and diſhonour to all earthly excellency and beauty, even as the glory and ſplendour of the Sun at noon day abaſeth the appearance of a candle; for the carnall laws and inſtitutions of the world cannot retain their force, if the wiſdom of God take place; therefore this <hi>Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſalem</hi> in erecting of her orders and ordinances periſhable ſhe muſt terminate the word of God in them, as the intent thereof, or elſe they are not in force to inſnare the conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, neither would they otherwiſe appear of any more worth than the laws given to the beaſts of the field or the fowls of heaven, which is neither ſin to break, ſimply conſidered, nor righteouſneſſe to fulfill; therefore they are bonnd over by the law of a carnall commandement, to terminate the
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:40942:143"/>
mind and will of God in humane orders and inſtitutions, in the neglect and rejecting of that glory of God which ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears in Ieſus Chriſt, diſallowing and diſanulling in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves that eternall word and law of the ſpirit of life, which is in Ieſus Chriſt, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 2. which only frees from the law of ſin and death, and whereſoever that law is not acknowledged there ſin reigns.</p>
            <p>Now whoſoever nullifies the ſpirit and life of the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, by erecting a carnall commandement, he therein nulli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies the true ſpirit of prophecy, and he that nullifies the ſpirit of the Prophets, he takes away the life of the Prophets, and ſo becomes a Murtherer of all the Prophets; for the ſpirit of the Scriptures is of that comprehenſion in the true intent thereof, as that it is the only life of all Prophets in every age of the world, without any alteration of Gods proper intent therein, no more than there was ever found ſalvation in any other, but only Ieſus Chriſt, <hi>Acts</hi> 4. 10. 11. 12.</p>
            <p>And therefore every carnall ſpirit is bound over for the conſervation of humane order, in the erecting and maintai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning thereof, upon its proper principles, to extinguiſh and put out the proper life and ſpirit of the Scriptures, other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe he cannot maintain his laws in force, according to the nature of them, in their height and glory, which man natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally ſtrives after, and can never attain unto any eminency therein, but by quenching of the ſpirit of God, and deſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing true prophecy, 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 5. 19. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

            <p n="2">2 Therefore Chriſt addes the ſecond act in his charge, againſt them, telling them that they are ſuch <hi>as ſtone them that are ſent unto them;</hi> we heard before, how true Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets are ſaid to be ſent to theſe wicked Scribes and Phariſees as they are the off-ſpring of the Serpent, and of ſuch fathers as killed the Prophets, and here it is ſaid, they are ſent to the originall and mother of them, that is, <hi>Ieruſalem,</hi> from

            <p>For ſhall we think that marriage, which is the way of the multiplication of man, and ſo the ground of all humane in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitutions, is any point of the proper end of the law of God, when as it is plain that Chriſt is the end of the law for righteouſneſſe, <hi>Rom.</hi> 10. 4. but marriage (as a humane act) may attaine its end in a wicked man as well as in a juſt man, or elſe it were ſinfull to conſent to the marriage of unbeleevers.</p>
            <p>Again, if marriage (ſimply conſidered) were any part of the end of the law, then would Chriſt Ieſus the fulfiller of the Law, <hi>Mat.</hi> 5. 17. never have neglected that relation; but he doth it of purpoſe to declare, that as naturall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception is not intended to be that which brings forth the Son of God, and therefore he is conceived by the holy Ghoſt; in like manner naturall marriages and contracts is not the thing intended by the word of God in the fulfilling of the Law, and therefore he enters not into that rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, for the conſultation of the groſſeneſſe of mans cogi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations therein.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="233" facs="tcp:40942:144"/>
Therefore the ſpirit of the Scriptures ſolicite carnall <hi>Ieru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem,</hi> as having relation to the Iebuſites, for the abrogation of her ſinfull and murthering laws, as ſhe ſets the ſcope of the word of God in vaniſhing things, which is as durable in its proper end, in all things, as in its foundation, <hi>Rev.</hi> 22. 13. and beginning.</p>
            <p>Such laws therefore as receive ſtrength by terminating the word of God in tranſient and momentany things, (as the Laws and orders of <hi>Ieruſalem</hi> that now is, and is in bondage with her children, ever did) <hi>Gal.</hi> 4. 24. 25. and therefore the Prophets ever cry out and inveigh againſt their Sacrifices, Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baths, New Moons, and ſolemn Aſſemblies, Temple, Prieſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood, Faſts, and all manner of exerciſes, which God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf had commanded, only they underſtood and uſed them in a litteral and carnall manner, terminating the end of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement in things that fade and vaniſh, which laws are the very ground and fountain of all uncleanneſſes and abhomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations ſpringing up among the ſons of men in the World, <hi>Iſaia</hi> 1. <hi>Iſaia</hi> 58. <hi>Ezek.</hi> 23. 38. 39. the miſtake and miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſtruction of the word of God in this point, is the proper prophanation of all things amongſt the ſons of men; therefore <hi>Ieruſalem</hi> is ſaid to ſtone them that are ſent, intimating there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by, that ſhe doth it by her Laws and Ordinances, alluding to the Law of <hi>Moſes,</hi> which appointed Malefactors to be ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to death, <hi>Lev</hi> 2. 2. 27. <hi>Deut.</hi> 13. 10. <hi>Deut.</hi> 17. 5. and in that includes all other laws inſtituted by a falſe conſtruction of the word of God, whereby in her executions ſhe brings the word of God for what ſhe doth, for her defence, as though ſhe did nothing but by the command and direction thereof, which is only brought in as the Devill did the word of God in the tempting of Chriſt, which Chriſt gives a quite contrary meaning thereof, than the Devill intended, <hi>Mat.</hi> 4. 5.-10. which is the proper overcoming of the tentation, and by this falſe and ſatanicall alleging of the word of God, falſe Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preters do blind both themſelves and the world, and thereby direct the force of their law againſt a wrong object, and ſo exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe their cruelty upon the innocent, inſtead of the guilty party; for we ſhall hardly find a wicked Lawyer, or judge in the

world, that cannot by this means find ſome fault with a godly man, according to his interpretation of the law of God; for it is eaſily ſaid thou art an Heretick, Sciſmatick, or a Blaſphemer, a mover of Sedition, troubler of the ſtate, or enemy to <hi>Caeſar, Acts</hi> 24. 5. <hi>Acts</hi> 18. 12. 13. <hi>Iohn</hi> 19. 12. 13. <hi>Acts</hi> 17. 6. 7.</p>
            <p>But the queſtion is, by what law he is made ſuch a one, whether by the law of faith, or by the law of ſin and death; for if the Judge be not able to interpret the word of God, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Law of faith<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and ſo be a Preacher of righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. 5. otherwiſe the word of God is become in him a law of ſin and death, directing him to the innocent, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of the guilty, and therefore his judgement muſt needs paſſe, according to the will and law of Satan, and not of Chriſt.</p>
            <p>Not that we deny that the ſentence and execution of death may paſſe amongſt men upon the face of the earth, we only plead for a juſt and righteous law, by which it is done, other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe the judgement is as ready to take hold of the innocent, as of the malefactor, for the maintaining of the Judges own ends and honour; for if a wicked Iudge did it not for ſiniſter ends and reſpects, he would only bend the force of the l aw againſt the godly of the Land, and not againſt them of his own ſpirit, as all wicked men are, only they become Tormen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters one of another.</p>

Obſerve, that in the ground of all Law, there are two Tables conſiderable, that is, not only the Letter and the Spirit, but alſo Kingdome and Prieſthood, and thence it is ſaid, <hi>The Lord ſaid to my Lord, ſit on my right hand, Pſalm</hi> 110. 1. for there is a Lordſhip on the right hand in both, and they are never ſeparated in Chriſt, but ever ſubſiſt and exiſt in the power and royalty of faith, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. 9. <hi>Exod.</hi> 19. 6. even as they were both found in that one <hi>Melchizedek,</hi> King of <hi>Salem,</hi> Prieſt of the moſt high God, <hi>Gen.</hi> 14. 18. <hi>Heb.</hi> 7. 1.</p>

            <p>Again, the wiſdome of man was never formed nor uttered, but the wiſdome of God was included in the expreſſion; for the wiſdom of man with reſpect to God and himſelf, and all the Creatures, is the true Character or Letter of the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures; and this wiſdome of man, for the preſervation and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>altation of it ſelf, forms God unto it ſelf according to its own proper principles, where the light of the Spirit of God ſhines not, which this wiſdome prevents that it takes not place, which doth ſo far manifeſt it ſelf, that man cannot but acknowledg that there is a higher &amp; more principal thing than
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:40942:151"/>
that w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> he ſo voluntarily makes choice of unto himſelf; ſo that it is an apparition of the wiſdom of God, which he forms accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to his earthly capacity, and in ſo doing the word of God is in him altered from its own nature, proper diſpoſition and operation, which it hath in that wiſdome and form of the Son of God, as man, in that way of Chriſt or wiſdome of God, is altered and changed from his own nature, diſpoſition and proper operation, as he is conſidered a limb of Satan, ſon of perdition, dead in ſins and treſpaſſes, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 2. 1. 2. 3. 4. 5. 6. <hi>Col.</hi> 2. 13.</p>
            <p>So that the wiſdome of God utters not it ſelf in the Saints, but with reſpect to that wiſdome of man, which ſo falſifies the word of God, from which the wiſdome of God hath freed us, and by a perpetuall act triumphs over it; yet not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding this appearance of mans wiſdom is a powerfull aſſault of Satan, becauſe a Saint of God, as he is conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red man, is by nature in that reſpect, as prompt to work upon the ſame principles as any other man, and it is only the wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome and ſpirit of God by which he is a continued and perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuated victor; and hereby all the aſſaults of Satan are over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come only by this wiſdome and Son of God, and not by any thing that is of man.</p>
            <p>So likewiſe the wiſdome of man moves not, upon any word or work of God, but there is a higher excellency and vertue preſents it ſelf, therefore <hi>Pharaoh</hi> though he would not acknowledge the Lord of the <hi>Hebrews,</hi> yet he appeals unto his Magicians, and unto <hi>Moſes</hi> alſo, for help when they could not do it; ſo did <hi>Nebuchadnezzar</hi> appeal to his Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cians for ſome higher revelation than himſelf had, and they themſelves acknowledge a higher than they; as if there were a poſſibility for the Gods to come down and interpret the dream, <hi>Dan.</hi> 2. 10. 11. whoſe dwelling is not with fleſh, nor with any tranſitory and carnall ordinance or inſtitution what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever ordained by the King; and this appearance of a higher wiſdome and power is a ſtrong ſolicitation and onſet given up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on all wicked men to imbrace and accept of that wiſdome and authority wherein only ſafety doth conſiſt, becauſe the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt; and it is a ſtrong aſſault and viſitation, becauſe there is
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:40942:151"/>
that in a wicked man, which is of its own nature as ready and willing to accept and yeeld it ſelf over unto that wiſdom and authority, as it is in any man whatſoever; for the Spirit of God is as really, and in a like ſence, in the moſt wicked that ever was, or ſhall be, as the ſpirit of man is in the moſt juſt and righteous one that ever was or ſhall be, name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the Son of God.</p>
            <p>Now the wiſdom of man by falſe interpretation preventing the wiſdom and ſpirit of God of its proper work, it is his fall from God, and falſifying the word of God in its proper intent, deſtroyes the true ſpirit &amp; life of all true Prophets, which are as really ſent unto them that thus deal with them, as Satan himſelf is a tempter of Chriſt, and as the Prince of this World coms in temptation, and finds nought in Chriſt to, faſten a tenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion upon, <hi>Iohn</hi> 14. 30. ſo doth the King of Saints ſolicite the world to accept of the wiſdome and work of God in ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, but findes nothing in that Son of perdition, to faſten ſalvation upon; therefore they ſtone them that are ſent unto them.</p>
            <p>Note hence, that there is no true, reall and proper power of God, but that which ſprings f om the true interpretation of the word of God, for it is the word of God which gave all things their being at the firſt, &amp; conſerves them in their being, &amp; operation unto this day, now the word of God which gave all things their being, is the wiſdom of God, and this wiſdom of God is only in Chriſt who <hi>is the wiſdom of God &amp; the power of God,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1. 24. out of whom there is no proper wiſdome and power, which God owns as his; therefore without the opening and revelation <hi>of the truth as it is in Ieſus, Epheſ.</hi> 4. 21. there is no proper wiſdom or power of God extant a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the ſons of men, but what is exerciſed among men, otherwiſe is that Kingdome of darkneſſe, wiſdome of the Serpent, and power of the Devill, and what power or ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue there is in any, or all other Creatures, is to be referred un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to one of theſe, and according to that uſe which man makes thereof, ſo it becomes cleane or uncleane, unto him, and is either Chriſtian (in its uſe) or diabolicall, <hi>Titus</hi> 1. 15. <hi>Rom.</hi> 14. 20.</p>

               <pb n="248" facs="tcp:40942:152"/>
3 The third point noted in the order of the Text, is Chriſts interrogation: <hi>How often would I have gathered thy Children together?</hi> wherein obſerve,</p>
            <p n="1">1 Chriſts appeal to the conſcience of all wicked men<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that his ſolicitations and viſitations for their recovery have been evident and are apparently known unto them, which ſtand upon record in their hearts, and can never be blotted out, nor denyed; for the clearing of this point, read <hi>Pſalm</hi> the 78. throughout.</p>
            <p n="2">2 Secondly, note the multiplication of this his ſolicitation; <hi>How often,</hi> that is, my onſets upon thy children and Off-ſpring have been ſo reiterated, multiplyed, and conſtantly exhibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and repreſented, that they cannot be reckoned, they are altogether innumerable, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 81. 8.-16.</p>
            <p n="3">3 Obſerve what the proper will of the Son of God is; <hi>How often would I have gathered thy Children together?</hi> that is, my will is only to gather mankind into unity with God, for out of him there is no unity; therefore he ſaith, <hi>how often would I have gathered thy Children into unity;</hi> that is the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per nature, endeavour, and will of Chriſt, and he can no more will the death, deſtruction and diſſipation of mankind, than Satan himſelf can will to ſubmit, and ſubject himſelf to the wiſdome of God in Chriſt, which he is at utter enmity againſt; Chriſts will is therefore to bind over by law unto the way of ſalvation, and it is this carnall <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> which binds over by the law of the fleſh unto deſtruction, ſo as her children will not be reclaimed; God in the way of Chriſt can no more will or deſire the deſtruction of mankind, than he could will or deſire to annihilate the world upon the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of it, that his whole work ſhould be in vain, and to no purpoſe.</p>
            <p>It is not in the Son of God to will deſtruction, therefore he takes a ſolemn Oath upon it, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 33. 11. <hi>Ezek.</hi> 18. 23. <hi>As I live, ſaith the Lord, I deſire not the death of him that dyes,</hi> and his <hi>will is, that all men ſhould be ſaved, and come to the knowledge of the truth,</hi> 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2. 4. ſo that God in the way of Chriſt hath no will for deſtruction, for his will is his law, and the law of the ſpirit of life in Chriſt Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:40942:152"/>
only <hi>ſaves,</hi> and it is the law of ſin and death, <hi>wherein de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction doth conſiſt,</hi> which is no will nor law peculiar unto God, but proper to Satan, therefore he adds <hi>but ye would not<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> ſo that deſtruction conſiſts in the law of this corrupt City, and practice of her children; it is their wil and law to have it ſo, not that deſtruction depends upon the will of a Creature, but it depends upon the law of ſin &amp; death, in falſe interpretation of the Word of God wherein they have formed the Word and work of God into the will, and wiſdome, or naturall reaſon of a man, whereby the word is become the word of the curſe, a ſavour of death, and the Spirit of God a tormenter of mankinde, as really as man in Chriſt is become a holy and a bleſſed Saviour, and reconciler, making peace between God and man, and ſo gathering them into unity for ever.</p>
            <p n="4">4 The fourth point is the manner how Chriſt ſtrives with man, ſet out in this metaphor, <hi>As the hen gathereth her Chickens under her wings.</hi> In this Metaphor we are to Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider, how a Hen gathereth her Chickins under her wings, or her <hi>Brood,</hi> or <hi>Neſt,</hi> as the word imports, and therefore is to be taken either as ſhee broods upon egges, to breed life, or as ſhee hovers upon her Chickens, for the ſafety and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation of them, <hi>Deut.</hi> 22. 6. and ſecondly, how it is ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicable unto Chriſt.</p>
            <p n="1">1 Firſt, we know a neſt cannot be Compleat without the maker of it, and therefore the dam or mother muſt be brought in as one with the egges or young, therefore it is ſaid that the Eagle ſtirreth up or maketh up her neſt, and fluttereth or mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth upon her young. <hi>Deut.</hi> 32. 11. that is, the neſt is made up and compleat, onely by the preſence of the dam, elſe either eggs or young ſuffer dammage.</p>

2 Secondly, the Hen neglects her ſelf, in the time of her brooding upon her neſt, that by her Conſtant hovering upon it, no ayre, or inconvenience, may ſeaze upon it to hinder life, in raiſing up her Kinde.</p>
            <p>Even ſo it is with Chriſt the wiſdome of God, it neglects it ſelf in all wicked men, that none of the vertues, or ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellencies of the Spirit of God are found there, though he be God; it neglects it ſelf alſo in that myſticall body of Chriſt, that no humane glory or excellency bee found there, though he be a man alſo; and from the ſufferings of the one, and of the other of theſe twain, he Broods upon the Saints to raiſe up an offſpring and generation of ſons unto God. And in this reſpect it is ſaid, that the Spirit of God over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhadowed the Virgin, <hi>Luk.</hi> 1. 35. Yea the power of the moſt High, So, as neither the glory and excellency of man, nor any wretchedneſſe or miſery of man, ſhould take place to Contribute any thing to the form and being of any of the ſons of God.</p>
            <p n="3">3 Thirdly, the Hen in brooding upon her Neſt transfu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth her own proper heat, life, and vertue, to give form and life unto her Neſt in rayſing up her Kinde, and not the heat or life of any other thing, the Fire, no nor Sun, or any ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tificiall heat deviſed will do it.</p>
            <p>Even So the Wiſdome, Life and Spirit of God transfuſeth it ſelf into the off-ſpring and ſons of God, to give them forme, life, and motion, as being naturallized and Kinded un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to God, and not any other influences, as a ſecondary, or mediate thing whatſoever, therefore <hi>in every one that is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led</hi> (for ſo the word is) <hi>both of Iewes and Grecians, Chriſt is the power of God and the wiſdome of God,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1. 24. and thence it is that <hi>our faith ſtands not in the wiſdome of men,</hi> (or any thing that they can transfuſe or inſtill) <hi>but in the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of God<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

            <p n="5">5 Fiftly, the Hen broods upon her Chickens to ſave them from harm of ſtorm and tempeſt, or birds of prey, which other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe they are Lyable unto.</p>

<pb n="252" facs="tcp:40942:154"/>
in their ebbings and flowings; Nay if we look down to mans ſin, fall from God, and imperction in all things, we are ready to bee inſnared with doubts and feares, and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>contentments with our own condition, and if we look up unto that happie and bleſſed eſtate of man in Chriſt, we are Ready to wax proud, arrogant, and wanton in the things of God, if this wiſdom of God do not brood and flutter upon us, and watch over us, that his power may prevent all inconveniences, that otherwiſe would fall upon us, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 77. 10. This wiſdom and Word of God is our onely ſtrength and help, in the true interpretation thereof, and without that there is no proper power or help of God at all, as is formerly noted, therefore it is ſaid, thou haſt advanced thy Word over all thy Name, or upon all thy Name or Authority and power, <hi>Pſalm</hi> 138. 2. So it is ſaid that the mercy of the Lord is over all his works, <hi>Pſalm.</hi> 145. 9. or upon all his works, That is, there is not a work of God in Heaven, or in Earth, but there is a ſtamp and impreſſion of the mercy of God upon it, with reſpect unto the Saints of God, yea every work of God is a Monument or Remembrancer of Gods mercy unto them: See an epitomee or breviary hereof, <hi>Pſalm</hi> 136. 1.-26. where the Spirit of God impreſſeth the mercy of God upon his works ſix and twenty ſeverall times.</p>
            <p>Even So the Lord hath magnified his Word upon all his Name, or his authority, and power, that is, there is no power and authority of God, but that which his Word in the true interpretation thereof inveſts into, it is that, and that onely, which ſets up, and maintaines Gods Name and Authority in all things whatſoever, and without the true interpretation of the Word of God, his Name is not magnificall in the heart of any man, likewiſe there is nothing whereby the power of Satan is advanced in the world, but onely the falſe interpretation of the Word of God, neither is there any contention among the ſons of men (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides that contending for the common ſalvation, by faith once given unto the Saints, <hi>Jude</hi> 3.) But it ariſeth from a miſtake and falſe interpreting of the Word of God, for it is at unity with it ſelf, where &amp; in whomſoever it is truly acknowledged.
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:40942:154"/>
We Conclude then; that it is Word of God which is the wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of God, that is, the proper wing of God, under which the Saints are gathered, which falſe interpreters refuſe to come under.</p>

            <p>Neither doth Salvation depend upon the meer will of an Eternall God, ſimply conſidered, but it depends upon the Law of the ſpirit of life, which is in Chriſt Ieſus, which is that word or wiſdome of God rightly opened and inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preted, elſe doth not Salvation conſiſt only in Chriſt Ieſus, who is God and Man, as the wiſdome of God affirms it doth, <hi>Acts</hi> 4. 11, 12. <hi>And this is the Stone caſt aſide by you builders which is become the head of the Corner.

            <p>Firſt obſerve in the affirmation, a note of admiration and wonder, that the wiſdome of God ſhould ſpeak and expreſſe it ſelf unto men, and they not give Credit thereunto, Behold ſaith he and wonder, admire unto aſtoniſhment, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction, that the prophecie which hath foretold theſe things, is fulfilled upon you, <hi>Habba.</hi> 1. 5. which the Apoſtle applies to a like act of the wicked Iewes, where he ſaith, <hi>Behold ye diſpiſers, and wonder, and vaniſh away, Acts</hi> 13. 41. or, periſh, for the reiection and neglect of the wiſdome of God
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:40942:156"/>
preſented unto the world, and uttered in Chriſt, is the proper condemnation and deſtruction of the ſons of men; therefore the Prophet ſaith, <hi>For I will work a work in your daies, yee will not beleeve it, though it be told unto you.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Here is then a deſcription of the habitation and abode, as the proper brood and neſt of all falſe Interpreters, in oppoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to that which Chriſt gathereth his own people into.</p>
            <p>And this devaſtation here affirmed to be the portion of all falſe Interpreters, is the very ſame which is propheſied of all Chriſts Enemies, <hi>Pſalm</hi> 69. 26. and is in particular applyed un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <hi>Iudas Iſcariot</hi> that Confeſſor for hire, <hi>Acts</hi> 1. 20. (as his name ſignifies) or man that praiſeth the wayes of death (as all ſuch do) to declare unto us that deceitfull, treacherous, and perfidious ſpirit; as alſo that horrid deſtruction which ever at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends the falſe interpretation of the Word of God, which ever bereaved men of all Office and Apoſtleſhip, of all Vertue and Operation, of all holy Miniſtry and Service, yea of all Life, Spirit, and Power that appertains to the Houſe and Kingdom of God; therefore <hi>Iudas</hi> is ſaid to go to his own place, as one eſtranged from that place and inheritance of the Son of God, <hi>Acts</hi> 1. 25. So that this deſolation, and depopulation of the habitation of the wicked, is the fulfilling of it with death and deſtruction, and with all wickedneſs and abomination, as in <hi>Simon Magus,</hi> who valued the gifts of the Spirit of God according to an earthly eſtimation, which is ever accompanyed with a deſtructive and periſhing condition, <hi>Acts</hi> 8. 20. For it is that unclean ſpirit which goeth out of the Man, or out in a human manner in the things of God, walking through dry places, barren of the diſtillations of the Spirit of God, ſeeking reſt, but hath none to give, and therefore never finds it; for the Spirit of Chriſt doth as truly gives reſt as receives it.</p>
            <p>But this unclean ſpirit conſulting with it ſelf, preacheth a return to his houſe out of which he came<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that is, he came out of the houſe of uncleanneſs, and thither he returns; for as the holy Spirit of Chriſt comes, or proceeds out of a pure and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corrupted Fountain<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as it deſcends from the Father, yet as the ſpirit of man is in unity therewith<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> there is a real ſeparation
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:40942:156"/>
and ſanctification from uncleanneſs, and all impurity, which otherwiſe man naturally is; therefore Chriſt is truly ſaid to be <hi>made in us Wiſdom, Righteouſneſs, Sanctification, and Redem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1. 30.</p>
            <p>Even ſo that Spirit of man going out in the matters of God by human wiſdom, in that reſpect goeth out of an unclean and corrupt Fountain or habitation; for Earth holds no correſpon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dencie, nor hath any congruity with Heaven, the Creature with the Creator, but falls infinitely ſhort in all things; not a blemiſh forbidden in all the Sacrifices and Offerings, but in that reſpect he hath the defect, ſuperfluity, and defilement up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him, yet doth he corrupt a pure and holy thing in himſelf, and unto himſelf, namely, the holy Word of God, in the falſe conſtruction thereof; ſo that as this unclean Spirit corrupts a pure Word of Eternity in it ſelf, mortalizing it by putting it into a human form, ſo alſo its return is into an houſe of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleanneſs, of like antiquity, in point of the ſtate of death and mortality, and ſo is truly ſaid to go out of an unclean habita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which never was otherwiſe, and yet he makes it un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clean and deſolate of all the things of God unto himſelf, by falſe interpretation, bringing the will of God unto the mind of the Creature, and not the mind of the Creature to the will of God.</p>
            <p>But the Spirit of Chriſt coming out of a clean Fountain, even from God himſelf, and therefore is ſaid to <hi>come forth from God, and go to God,</hi> Ioh. 13. 1. yet doth he purifie in himſelf that which by nature is otherwiſe unclean, namely the ſpirit of man, elſe were he not the ſon of Man, as he is called a matter of eighty eight ſeveral times in the Prophecie of <hi>Ezekiel;</hi> and according to the eternity of that Word, or Spirit that purifies, ſuch is the ſtate and condition of the purified; for they are no more twain, but one, <hi>Mat.</hi> 19. 6. And thence it is, that Man, who otherwiſe is mortal, lives an eternal, and immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal life, being that the Wiſdom of <hi>God</hi> hath formed his mind according to the Will of <hi>God,</hi> and not to the will or law of a creature and ſo Man in Chriſt, who otherwiſe is mortal lives for ever, and knows no death no more than <hi>En ch</hi> did, <hi>Gen.</hi>
               <pb n="258" facs="tcp:40942:157"/>
5. 24. who was tranſlated that he ſhould not ſee death, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11. 5. That is, that he ſhould never taſt of it, or feel the nature thereof; ſo the <hi>Pſalmist</hi> ſaith, <hi>Taſt and ſee how gracious the Lord is,</hi> Pſal. 34. 81.</p>
            <p>And the Son of God, who otherwiſe is immortal, doth in that way of Antichriſt dye an eternal death, where never any life appears, but a mortal ſtate and condition of like time of him who is mortalized, therefore they are ſaid to go into e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verlaſting fire, which muſt have reſpect to time paſt as well as time to come, <hi>Mat.</hi> 25. 41. Therefore <hi>Tophet</hi> is prepared <hi>of old,</hi> or of antiquity, or from eternity, as the word imports; yea it is prepared for the King, the burning whereof is fire and much wood, and the breath of the Lord, as a River of Brimſtone, kindles it, <hi>Iſaiah</hi> 30. 33. So that as antient as the breath of the Lord is, ſo antient is that place of abode for the wicked; therefore a full meaſure of wrath, in point of time, as well as preſent torment. So that unclean ſpirit is ſaid to take ſeven ſpirits worſe than himſelf; that is, fulneſs of uncleanneſs and vexation; which a creature ſimply conſidered could never have; therefore his going out in the matters of God in a carnal man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, is the way of his multiplication of miſchief in himſelf; therefore his houſe is empty and ſwept of all the things of God, but furniſhed with all uncleanneſs and wickedneſs ſuita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to that unclean and wicked condition; therefore the end of that man is worſe than his beginning; for the original, and proper ground ofthis abomination, ariſeth from the creature, whichin it ſelf is but a finite thing, as all other creatures are; but his end and ſcope being to adorn himſelf with God, in making him like to himſelf, as the <hi>Pſalmiſt</hi> ſpeaks, <hi>Pſal</hi> 50. 21. thence it is that God becomes a fearfull and infinite death and torment to him, which all the creatures in the world could ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver be.</p>
            <p>And of ſuch nature and concernment is the houſe or habita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of theſe falſe Teachers, which is left unto them, or in them, deſolate of all the things proper to God, and filled with all the things of Satan, even as <hi>Iudas</hi> was, to become his own Execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioner, and the burſting of him in ſunder, that all men might
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:40942:157"/>
ſee his abomination and ſhame, who is ſaid to goe to his own place, <hi>Act.</hi> 1. 25. as one laid waſte of all Apoſtleſhip and Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtry in the Faith of Chriſt, and therfore his proper inheritance or habitation yeelds him nothing that is holy or profitable to Miniſter, but is voyd and deſolate of all. Neither hath he any life or ſpirit to move or act in the things of God, though ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred unto him; for he is dead, and gone to his own place, and office of an eternal executioner of himſelf. And this is the deſolation of the habitation applied to <hi>Iudas,</hi> the falſe, and counterfeit betrayer of Chriſt with a kiſs, which Chriſt ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyes hereunto all falſe Interpreters of the Word of God (in theſe Scribes and Phariſees) who faun upon Chriſt in their Doctrin in all lowly demeanour, to maintain &amp; uphold him in the ways of the fleſh by things mortal &amp; momentary, &amp; ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by give a ſign unto the world for the betraying of that life and ſpirit of the Son of God into the cruel hands of the wicked, that the law of the Spirit, or Chriſt taught after the Spirit, wilnot be ſuffered or endured among them, the habitation of ſuch Confeſſors, Phariſees, or Preachers of Chriſt (with <hi>Iudas)</hi> is left unto them deſolate, without any in-dwellings of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of God with them, or any building up of the Houſe of God by them, but ruination of themſelves and others (with <hi>Iudas)</hi> who are their maintainers and upholders.</p>
            <p>The Reaſon of this Deſolation and Deſtruction follows; <hi>For ye ſhall not ſee me henceforth.</hi> Whence obſerve, that the want of Chriſts ſight and revelation in the world, is the cauſe of all ruin and deſolation of the world, as Chriſt affirms, <hi>With<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out me</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>ye can do nothing,</hi> Ioh. 15. 5. It is alike true, without me ye have nothing, without me ye are nothing. Chriſt is unto man that <hi>Microſmos,</hi> or little world, as the Sun in the Firmament is unto this ſpherical world; take away and annihilate the one or the other, and all things therin periſh and come to ruin. Want of true Revelation is the cauſe of all Deſolation and Deſtruction.</p>

Again, whereas he ſaith, <hi>Ye ſhall not ſee me</hi> henceforth, the word <hi>henceforth</hi> in this place comprehends the time paſt, as well as the time to come.

            <p>And thus the Prophet <hi>Micha</hi> underſtands this phraſe, where he ſaith, that God will make her that halteth a Remnant, and her that was caſt far off a mighty Nation, and the Lord ſhall reign over them in Mount <hi>Zion,</hi> from henceforth, even for ever; where he expounds <hi>henceforth</hi> to be for ever, which comprehends all time paſt and to come; for the wiſdom of God was ſet up and advanced from the beginning; no time can be found when that hath not the rule and ſupremacie, <hi>Mich.</hi> 4. 7. <hi>Prov.</hi> 8. 22-30.

Falſe interpretation of the word of God, therefore (upon the affirmation, and verity of the Son of God) never did, nor ſhall, inveſt into the Office and Prieſthood of Ieſus Chriſt. It never attained unto the skill to Sacrifice and flay the Beaſt, upon the Altar, to Crucifie the World unto it ſelf, and it ſelf, unto the World, accounting that the onely Ioy and Glory to be delighted in, <hi>Gallatians</hi> 6. 14. It never attains to the offering up unto God the fruits of an Eternall ſpirit, as that which is onely acceptable to God, without the inſtitution or addition of any things tranſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent and temporary (whatſoever) for Chriſt who is onely acceptable to God, ſo offereth up himſelf, once and for ever, in the true operation, and continued act of accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation thereof, for the act and acceptation are of like con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuance, and have the ſame place of reſidenccy, for where the one is found, there is never the abſence of the other, <hi>Hebrewes.</hi> 9. 14. For Chriſt is both the one and the other.</p>
            <p>Again, falſe Interpretation can never make God its onely inheritance and portion, to live on him onely in the exerciſe of its Miniſtery, becauſe it terminates the word in carnall things, and therefore is bound over to ſeek ſome certainty and ſettlement in the things of this preſent life, and cannot as a pilgrim in point of all tranſitory things where ever he comes, commit himſelf to God, as his onely and allſufficiency, as the true Prieſts, and Prophets of God have ever done, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to that Royall Ordination and apointment of God, <hi>Deut.</hi> 18. 1, 2. <hi>Num.</hi> 18. 20. 21. who is become their lot, and happy inheritance, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 16. 5, 6. even of all true worſhippers, who are made Kings and Prieſts unto God, <hi>Revel.</hi> 5. 10. <hi>Revel.</hi> 1. 6.</p>

            <p>And this reconciliation of the Word of God, is as ſtrange a thing to a naturall minde, as to bring the ſtrict Iew, and the profane Gentile to become one, and that to the minde of a car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall interpreter, takes a man (being a Iew, or a Confeſſour according to the letter) as far from the Word of God (as it is the ground of his beleeſe) as the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> that Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter

Friend, the Lord hath drawn forth our hearts, to this place in much love, knowing in the light, that he hath a great ſeed among you, though ſcattered up and down<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and are as ſheep without a ſhepherd<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and you are travelling from Mountain to Hill in your wiſedome and imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, the reſting place being not yet known, nor cannot be known by the higheſt wiſdome of the world, but in the deniall of it; for there is ſomething underneath, which is not, nor cannot be ſatisfied with all the divings into the mystery of things declared in the Scriptures of truth, which is the man of Gods portion, and was given to that to profit withall, that it might be throughly furniſhed to every good word and work, but this is too low a thing for thoſe which are high in their wiſdome and knowledge, which they can hardly ſtoop unto, that is to become fools that they may be wiſe, that the pure wiſdome may dwell with them for evermore.</p>

               <p>WE have thankfully received your late and loving Letters, but are informed that ſince the penning of them the Maſter of the Ship is ingaged with two of <hi>Boſton</hi> bound with him, to ſet you aſhoar in <hi>England;</hi> ſo that we per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive God hath diverted our deſired deſigne, we doubt not but for the beſt in a further diſcovery of that ſpirit ſo wickedly bent to hinder (if it were poſſible) the fruitfull progreſſe of the grace of the Goſpell; and it may be, the name given unto you (we know not upon what ground) may come through an unalterable appointment, to be the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall practice of ſuch as ſo deal with you, when the terrours of the Almighty ſhall take hold of them: And we are glad to ſee the waters move, for then we know that ſpirit ſtirs which brooded upon them in the beginning, and the Angell troubleth them unto healing, but it is only of ſuch as firſt ſtep in, after the troubling or moving of them, which muſt be he who firſt lookes out from the early morning, ſeeing
<pb n="279" facs="tcp:40942:167"/>
in the firſt light that ever ſhined in that day which ſprings from on high, who is endued with ſtrength ſufficient to put himſelf in, without help of any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther beſides himſelf; for there is none but the firſt begotten of the dead that can participate in this cure; yet we know alſo how to cure the lame and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potent, who hath no ſtrength nor abilitie at all (in himſelf) to move towards the waters, but only waits for help from another, and therefore perceives how all come to be cured before him<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but the of word ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation paſſing upon him, retains its healing and cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ating vertue from the beginning, and is no leſſe healthful in the laſt, than in the firſt, for they are one.</p>

               <p>In that you ſay, that in the ſpirit of meekneſſe and lowlineſſe, out of much love you came into theſe parts, ſuch a ſpirit we can thankfully imbrace, knowing that it is the Spirit of the Redeemer, who is meek in the loſſe of all humane and worldly helps,
<pb n="280" facs="tcp:40942:168"/>
without the leaſt murmuring or grudging, not ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning his mouth in the language of the world in any thing whatſoever: Alſo lowly ſubmitting unto the ſpirit and will of the Father, in whom, or in whom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever it appeareth the Spirit of the loving and loy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all Spouſe never admits of any divorſe in that eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pouſall<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but in all things ſubmits unto, and obeys <hi>Abraham,</hi> and cals him. And whoſoever doth not become as a little child, cannot enter into the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of Heaven.</p>
               <p>But we know alſo, that he who comes meek and lowly, he comes ſo (therein) as he ſaves himſelf, which is the part of a Victor and Conquerour, and the prudent and diligent woman or Spouſe, clothes her Husband and Family with Scarlet, her Husband is known in the Gate, when he ſitteth among the Elders, by her induſtry, yea the heart of her Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band doth ſafely truſt in her, ſo as he fears no ſpoil; and whoſo becomes as a child, is greateſt in the Kingdome of Heaven; for in the mouths of Babes and Sucklings God hath ordained and founded his ſtrength.</p>
               <p>And in us a Child is born, in us a Son is given, but the government is upon his ſhoulder, and he is called Wonderfull Counſeller, the mighty God t e everlaſting Father, the Prince of Peace: ſo that whereever this lowly and meek Spirit is, there is alſo the Spirit of that Lyon of the Tribe of <hi>Iudah,</hi> and the Lord thereby ſhall roar out of <hi>Zion,</hi> and ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter his voice from <hi>Ieruſalem.</hi> and the Heavens and the Earth ſhall ſhake, but the Lord is the hope of his people, and the ſtrength of the Children of <hi>Iſrael.</hi>

True lowlyneſs of ſpirit, and the loftieſt minde that ever was, are never ſeparated; for theſe twain are made one ſo, as never to be ſeparated, no more than a child (in point of all humane abilities) and the antient of daies, ſhall; For as we receive the Kingdom of Heaven as a little child, ſo we are ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver otherwiſe in the ſame reſpect, which we know, no wiſdom humane, ſerpentine, or upon principles properto a creature, can ever yeeld unto, or finde out: And therefore we are fooles unto the world, being bereaved of all their principles, in regard of any exerciſe of them according to their proper in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent in any of our deſigns. Our wiſdom conſults not upon any of their principles, our judgement deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mines not according to any of their principles, our faith depends not upon any of their principles, our love embraceth not upon any of their principles, our hope expects not upon any of their principles, nor doth our power and ſufficiencie ſtand upon any of their principles: And therefore as brute beaſts are unto them, ſo are they to us in the things of God, and we are unto them as men bereaved of their wits; for they cannot but diſcern a certain power of argument in us, beyond all brutiſh cogitations what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever, yea ſuch as tranſcends and over-tops, what is in themſelves; for the Wiſdom of God, though a meek and deſcended Wiſdom, yea fooliſhneſs in the worlds eſtimation, yet it over-powers, and over-tops the higheſt Cedars ſtanding in the worlds <hi>Lebanon,</hi> and is bottomed and founded upon grounds and undeniable reaſon, and true argument in Gods Wiſdom, yea argumentation for convicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="282" facs="tcp:40942:169"/>
and confirmation, infinitely ſurpaſſing and tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcending all Logical, and artificial argument, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing within the compaſs of human device and learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; therefore we conclude, that the Wiſdom of God, though become fooliſhneſs unto the world, yet doth it contain ſufficiencie of power in argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to over-top any Council, Synod, Synedrion, or Aſſembly compoſed by humane art and learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing: And that makes them ſo fearfull, and of ſuch care to guard themſelves from the apparition ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of.</p>
               <p>For as it is in that way of the devil, to propoſe his temptations from the Letter of the Scriptures, thinking to win or ſubdue Chriſt thereby: So is there ſufficiencie of ſpirit and wiſdom in the true interpretation thereof, to confound and bring them (in the party propoſing them) to nought.</p>
               <p>And whereas you ſay, <hi>There is a thing underneath, which cannot be ſatisfied vvith the divings into the my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtery of the Scriptures of truth,</hi> which phraſe as it ſeems to import, cannot be a <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ruth; for the myſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of the Goſpel is deſcribed to be Chriſt in you the hope of Glory. Now this Chriſt the Son of the Eternal comprehends all things really and eternal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly good, ſo that there is nothing ſo low but it is rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed up in him, nor any thing ſo high, but it is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcended in him, and ſo becomes a plain path, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on our God paſſeth in the wilderneſs; ſo that dive into him, as to lay open this Myſtery of the Word of Truth, and there is nothing ſo low <hi>underneath,</hi> nor any thing ſo high and above that can poſſibly
<pb n="283" facs="tcp:40942:169"/>
faile, or come ſhort of ſatisfaction which appertains unto the Saints and Sonnes of God; now that hee aſcended, what is it but that he alſo deſcended firſt into the lower parts of the earth; he that deſcended is alſo the ſame that aſcended up, far above all hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens, that he might fill all things, therefore diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover the myſterie of the Word, and it fills all things to ſatisfaction; for no man hath aſcended up to heaven but hee that came down from heaven, even the Son of Man which is in heaven. So that as you cannot goe above him who is height it ſelf, nor below that which is depth it ſelfe, ſo you cannot hide any thing above, or beneath, but the myſterie of the Word, is the light which finds it out, and brings ſatisfaction therewith; for the life &amp; the light are one, ever in conjunction with Chriſt from whom nothing is hid.</p>
               <p>Therefore we honour that phraſe in the true in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent thereof, that <hi>when you are clouded you vvait, and vvhen moved you journey;</hi> for we know the cloud to be the glory of Iſrael in the Wilderneſs, that wayleſs place, in point of any of the Nations, who cannot take a ſtep therein, but onely to the fall of their carkaſſes, yea even of carnal <hi>Iſrael.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>For this cloud is a cloud of witneſs, preſenting unto us a record, and teſtimony of the acts and deeds of all the Saints of God. Therefore as a pillar re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains and abides with us day and night, and is a co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver in the day; not to darken that light, and leading of the Angel of his face, but to over-ſhadow us, as we are the Virgin of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> than none of thoſe ſcor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching beams, or rayes of that Sun-ſhine or light of
<pb n="284" facs="tcp:40942:170"/>
the Nations takes place upon us, nor contributes no more to our being, than <hi>Ioſeph</hi> (that juſt man accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the law, or letter) did unto the conception of <hi>Mary.</hi> And in its ſtay and abode upon our Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bernacle, we ſo wait on God, as in exerciſe, in un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covering the Ark of his preſence, ordering the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruments and glories thereof, according to appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; and with <hi>Moſes</hi> turn in unto the Lord, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out either vale or covering, which abides on the heart of carnal <hi>Iſrael</hi> when <hi>Moſes</hi> is read unto this day, when we with open face, behold the glory of the Lord, as in a mirrour, and are changed into the ſame image, from all that glory of the Miniſtry of condemnation<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> conſiſting in the letter, unto that exceeding glory of the Spirit, wherein we ſtand with <hi>Moſes,</hi> converſing with God face to face, as a man talks with his friend. And this ſtate and manner of waiting upon God, he hath perpetuated in our hoſt, wherein (according to the prayer of <hi>Moſes)</hi> the Lord returns unto the many thouſands of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> for we have the record of them all in this cloud, and their order and exerciſe about the Ark.</p>
               <p>The Lord hath not left us without the teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of the motion of the cloud alſo, which he hath in like ſort perpetuated unto us; and that in the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſipation and ſcattering of the Nations, who are E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies unto God: And we daily find; that praier of <hi>Moſes</hi> in uſe, and fulfilling it ſelfe in us, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout us, <hi>viz. Ariſe, O Lord, and let thine enemies be ſcattered; let them alſo that hate thee fly before thee:</hi> For we daily have to doe with that people of that ſpirit amongſt whom you now are (yea and from the
<pb n="285" facs="tcp:40942:170"/>
floud unto the worlds end) by a ſpirit of Praier and Prophecie, which all the world can never bound, nor <hi>Herods</hi> Stone, Seal, nor Watch keep in the grave; But as it goes before the Diſciples into <hi>Galilee,</hi> ſo it rebukes the Nations, and brings the mad people to nought; elſe had you not ſeen thoſe lye dead before you on the ſhore (in your approach) ſo evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently as now you doe in point of any life, or light of Ieſus Chriſt.</p>
               <p>And in this diſmal and darkſom night which is now upon the world, this Cloud is a moſt firm and ſtately pillar of fire to give light unto us, and accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to its motion, either by night, or by day, we advance unto the vanquiſhing and vexation of the world.</p>
               <p>For the ſpirit of a Chriſtian knows how to graſp and gripe in the Nations, ſo as to cut off the ſpirit of Princes, and to be a terrour to the Kings of the earth, ſo as <hi>Herod,</hi> and all <hi>Iſrael</hi> after the fleſh, in all their Iewiſh inſtitutions ſhall be in trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble.</p>
               <p>A Chriſtian becomes a fool, in point of Serpents wiſdom in <hi>Herods</hi> Wiſemen, and <hi>Pharoahs</hi> Magici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans) is a comprehenſive thing, no leſs than the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per continent of an omnipotent power, who is able to doe all things through Chriſt who ſtrengthens him; for we dare not deny him to be ſet in heavenly places in Chriſt, yea at the right hand of power; and therefore ſits at the ſtearn of the world; layes hold on the helm, and governs the ſhip, to guide it unto its appointed haven.</p>
               <p>A Chriſtian is ſtil ſaying, let there be light, and it
<pb n="286" facs="tcp:40942:171"/>
is ſo, he ſhall ever divide the light from the darknes, &amp; the waters that are above the firmament from the waters that are below the out-ſpread firmament? In a word, he is forever to form all things out of that antient Chaos of God and Man being made one, which is a formleſs confuſion unto the higheſt top<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped-up pinacles of the wiſdome of this world, but onely as they beat out a tract unto themſelves through the Schools of mens policies and tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</p>
               <p>But a Chriſtian knows how to adorn that world whereof Chriſts Kingdome doth conſiſt, with all thoſe glorious ornaments of that new heaven and earth wherein righteouſneſs and peace dwels for e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver (where ſin and ſorrow fly away) and that out of the antient Chaos that abides for ever; and it is his glory, and perpetuated work in God, as alſo his reſt from all the works of darkneſs and death, to give every thing a right and due form, and an effectual na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and name, or authority, according thereunto, placing them in their proper relations, and giving them their operations, in the propagating and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moting of the glory of God. And this is a labour which for ever beſeems the honour and dignity of a Son of God, who will never be diſrobed of his creating virtue, as to admit a ceſſation thereof, no more than he can lay aſide the glory of his power to preſerve, order, and govern his kingdom.</p>
               <p>And this work or labour hath the reſt of God in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayled, and is never out of conjunction therewith, which is a day of reſt or ceſſation, from all opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of that evill one; yea it is a Sabbath (or as the
<pb n="287" facs="tcp:40942:171"/>
word ſignifies) an Hoſt or Army, not bounded by evening and morning; for it admits not of any peri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>od in the one nor in the other; for neither begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning nor end thereof can be found out. And this reſt and labour are of the ſame duration and conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuance, elſe were a Chriſtian utterly undone, but God hath made him Lord in, or of this Sabbath for ever, whilſt the carnal Jew (even thoſe amongſt whom you are) are in bondage under their Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath, for it Lords it over them, which they have ſet up as a God of time, as they have their Gods of creatures and bodily exerciſes, and this they fall down and kneel unto, as a God of four and twenty hours continuance.</p>

If you expect a feed of God among them, take heed it prove not of the God of this world, that ſeed of the ſerpent.

for if the Fountain of every thing in Chriſt were not inexhauſtible, heaven ſhould have an end, ſalvation ceaſed; for there is nothing in Chriſt wherein ſalvation doth not conſiſt, and that for e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver. And to preach, or profeſs Chriſt otherwiſe, falſifies the Goſpel, and makes the faith of the Son of God of no effect.</p>
               <p>We conclude then, that labour and reſt, harmo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nize, and kiſs each other in the Kingdom of God, conſiſting ſo in one that they ſhall never be parted, without demoliſhing of that work wherein God himſelf is one, not onely as a maker, but is made, Wiſdom, Righteouſneſs, Sanctification, and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption, in that myſtical body of Chriſt; which workmanſhip, and Maſterpeece of Gods Wiſdom and Skil, is onely aboliſhed in the men of the world, and ever was from the beginning; for the wicked are eſtranged from the womb; but in the Saints it never was, nor ſhall be impaired, for they are a congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the firſtlings of God which abide for e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver.</p>
               <p>Whereas you pleaſe to ſay, <hi>Wee are vvandring from mountain to hill in our imaginations, ſeeking reſt, but knovv not the place thereof.</hi> Indeed it is true, we know not that reſt which the world ever ſeeks after, in that way of the unclean ſpirit which goes out of the man of ſin, ſeeking it in barren and dry places, which are altogether deſtitute of the dews of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, that are the waterings of <hi>Zion,</hi> and of that Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veret which refr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

carnal operations of ſoul, that reſt which yet re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains for the people of God, as to enter into; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing daily as really renewed (as our Apoſtle proteſts he dies daily) although it be that which we have en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred into from the beginning, being of an eternall riſe, as all things proper to the Son of God are; who, however it be true, that he is a man, yet that which makes him to be ſuch a man, is of God, and not of the creature, and that in all things, yea death it ſelf in Chriſt, is not the death of a meer crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, or a momentany death, but it is the eternal death of the Son of God, for what Chriſt is, or doth once, it abides ſuch for ever, and otherwiſe no truth of the Goſpel appears.

And for our imaginations, they are ſuch as we can give a like good and certain account of them (in all particulars, and upon as reall and ſubſtantiall grounds) as we can give, for the appearing of the day, and ſucceeding of the night, or as we can give the reaſon why we eat, why we drink, why we ſleep, marry, and give in marriage, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out which things, man can neither multiply, nor tarry upon the face of the Earth, and we know the nature of all things that God reveals unto us, as well as we know the nature of the fire, by putting a finger into it, either the things of Satan in that body of ſin, as we dye unto it, and it is dead to us, or the things of God in Chriſt, as we live to them, and they live in us, and ſuch are our imaginations. And for our wandring from Mountain to Hill, we do profeſſe our ſelves to be gone from that rigid and mountainous power and pride of <hi>Pharaoh</hi> (under which in a Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure you now are) three dayes journey, a perfect and perpetuall departure therefrom, into that Wilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe that is wayleſſe of the tracts of <hi>Pharaoh</hi> and his Hoſt, elſe we had not come to <hi>Sinai,</hi> or <hi>Horeb,</hi> that hill of God, where he calls us up to converſe with him, in the height of his own Son, where we meekly receive that law of the ſpirit, in the laver of the People; yea, that fiery law, that borns up all combuſtible and corruptible matter in us, purifying and trying our faith, as ſilver is tryed in the fire.</p>

               <p>A true witneſſe is truly honourable, being one who only can give true teſtimony of the ſtate of all things ſo as true judgement paſſeth to give every thing its due, without which there is no righteouſneſſe on the Earth.</p>

ſuch as none can read but himſelf, and he is called the Word of God, which word is the law of the ſpirit of life, and this life is the light of men, and this light gives a true form unto all things which it teſtifies unto; therefore it is ſaid by the Lord unto <hi>Iob</hi> Haſt thou commanded the mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning ſince thy dayes, or cauſed the day-ſpring to know his place, that it might take hold of the ends of the Earth, that the wicked may be ſhaken out of it, it is turned as clay to the Seal, and they ſtand as a garment, but from the wicked their light is with-holden, and the high arm ſhall be broken.</p>
               <p>So that this true light lights us up to ſee the Son of God, as being of twain made one, for in what reſpect ſoever he appears, there is a true relation conſiderable in it, or elſe it is not that Son of God, the Saviour or ſalvation of the world; for he is of twain made one new man, in which is the Vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, as alſo the fellowſhip of the Goſpell in all things, for there is nothing in Chriſt, without its proper relative, and without relation, the word or law of God is not; as in creation the thing made, as well as the thing making, in knowledge, the thing known<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> in love, the thing beloved; in a Father, the reſpect to a Son; in a Husband, the reſpect to a wife; which gives to each other their proper being: ſo as if one ceaſe, the relative ceaſeth alſo from being ſuch.</p>
               <p>So that if I witneſſe to the Son, word, light, life, Law, or peace of God, I muſt witneſſe unto the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of ſuch a thing, that ſuch a thing it is, as alſo to the manner of its being, how it comes to be ſuch a

thing, together with its neceſſary and proper ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations, which muſt inevitably accompany ſuch a manner of being, with the comprehenſions &amp; exten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions of ſuch operations and motion, or elſe I am not that faithfull and true witneſſe, the beginning of the Creation of God, or that head and Maſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peece of his work, which carries and bears in it the excellencies and glories, yea the moſt eminent prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples of his wiſedom, goodneſſe and power if I can witneſſe thus of the light, then I can witneſſe how the world is in darkneſſe; for I know that an Idol is nothing of the proper workmanſhip of God, and that there is but one God, the maker of all things, what ever the world aſſumes to be their titles, as though there were many Gods, and Lords many, but to us there is but one true power, ſo that an Idol formed and ſet up by man, is the Devill, that <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baddon</hi> and <hi>Apollyon,</hi> the deſtroyer in, and unto him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, the whole work of God; ſo that in an Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lathite there is no light, no life, no Sonſhip of God, no word, nor law of God, for they are on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly governed by the law of ſin and death, and have no more of the law of God in them, than they have of the light or life God, being ſuch as are only in darkneſſe and death; if I then bear witneſſe againſt the world, I can teſtifie what the world is, namely, that Son of perdition, and not of peace; that it is, deſtruction, and not ſalvation; the Devil, and not the Son of God; darkneſſe, and not light; death, and not life, as alſo the true witneſſe declares, how the world comes to be ſuch a thing, namely how e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very wicked man is made a Devill, as Chriſt ſpeaks
<pb n="295" facs="tcp:40942:175"/>
concerning <hi>Iudas; Have not I choſen you tvvelve? and one of you is a Devill.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>For I can never give my ſelf ſatisfaction how a ſinner is made the Son of God, unleſſe it alſo appear unto me how <hi>Lucifer</hi> that day-ſtar, or Sun of the mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, is made a Devill; If I know not how it comes to paſſe that the Devill is juſtly condemned, I can never know how to bear witneſſe of the juſtice and righteouſneſſe of the Son of God, and then I fall ſhort of being that faithfull and true witneſſe: The like certainty then that I give and teſtifie, that the ſon of God is perpetuated in all things to be ſuch a thing, as at any time he appears to be, according to the truth of his being: the like certainty I can give unto the Devill to perpetuate him in every thing, wherein at any time he really appears to be that which he is; for the Black moor changeth not his skin, nor the Leopard his ſpots.</p>
               <p>Neither do the true lights in the Sanctuary and holy place of God, at any time go out, for the Trimmer of the Lamps, is skilfull, faithful, and watchfull, neither do thoſe two Olive-trees at any time want Oyle to contribute, through thoſe two golden Pipes (of every particular relation in Chriſt) into that one bowle, or unity of continent on the top of the Candleſtick, for the ſupply of the light, in the perfections thereof, being ſeven Lamps of light, which is that <hi>Vrim</hi> and <hi>Thum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
